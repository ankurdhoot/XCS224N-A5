You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I probably am the car for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a science.
I can see you as a gravity, or with a body, and no no one has gotten a crack.
I'm here today to talk to you about cartoons and experts.
And you know that a generation is not something that you can get in some place.
You just have to go back to the flower to see it as a experience.
That's the picture of a child.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bengual.
It is the kind of complicated college that I'm going to talk about.
My colleagues started in the "Seven years in the middle school, in Steve, where I was the car of the class.
When they were going to move up every week in the base of the kids, until a teacher came up with the life.
She came up with my life when I was going to go back to the base of the teachers of teachers room.
I was doing it in secret here.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to eat the city.
I had a play, and 15 dollars -- and I ended up in San Francisco -- California -- I found a love -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that are going on on the GDP that they worked against the GDP against AIDS on the AIDS
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone called the phone of that teacher -- the series put he said he said, I need to see you.
I am designed that we are never going to get up to us.
You could come to Ahla, and please go to that man that I know you've ever found them.
And I have to tell you that I have cancer, and I would like you to take you up with this for financial?
Well, the next day we were in Congo.
We were going to see it, we're going to see us, and we just realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found a place, we need it, and we're going to take it out of their family.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so how the woman I wanted to do as an adult came to think, became a control box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the carbon had been used -- it had become a college -- and that choice that I told you was made in itself.
The challenge is that death is part of life.
She came up with my life, and I went out of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need real and beauty and I'm very happy to talk a lot about this.
You also need -- needs difference, love and plant, and it's our work to protect those things.
Thank you.
And as an artist is very important to me.
through my work, I'm trying to explain that humans are not sure of the nature of nature and all of the whole thing.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first films.
I was amazing.
My heart. I was going to be made, trying to understand what was in front of me.
And I took them back to the water about 60 meters -- and I couldn't think that it was about a little bit about another single single single single single year after year.
They were born when you get out of the galaxies or it will go out of the ice backs.
Every amount has its own individual perspective.
They have a different way of interact with their environment and their experience.
Some of them are going to be able to go down and get up to the end of the end, while others can't make it more and they get them into a deception of a dark passion art.
It's easy to think, when you see a show, which are surrounded and soldiers, in a big matter as we see us sometimes as a humans.
But the reality is all of it.
And as you get a stage, I am going to get out of your anti-independent atmosphere.
And as you get a piece of a piece of a street that has been discovered by the rich distance that I feed a lot of life.
I was able to photograph these streams as if you were going to be able to be able to be able to know that in these moments are only in that way and not to get out of that way again.
It's not the death when they move down. It's not a end, but a conference of his way for the cycle of life.
part of the team of the teams that photograph is very young -- it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 billion years.
The last pictures I like to show you are about a show that I photograph in Web, Grand.
It's just a little bit about it is actually going to be able to be able to think about it.
Here you go.
You can see the left a little ball.
It's about five feet.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the team and your freedom of flower.
You can see here, starts to red, the boat has moved down the other side and the man is there.
This is a show of Germany, the average size of it.
It was about the water.
This video is in real time.
And so, the slide shows a different side of their perspective.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two parts in 1998, the same day, exactly in the same time, every one building a baby -- OK.
So two lost every one with a baby with a baby one.
I don't want you to get too much in the distribution of the context, because if you start thinking about the conference in it, they don't get to pay attention.
We think about that for a moment.
And in this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the seat and the hope is got up to the doctor of the video of the virus.
And in the other case, the X-ray bottle of the hope is going to the United States of the video.
These are both of them and you start life.
We're going to try to talk about them.
In my blood activity I would be able to be able to get two robots.
In one of my trees, I work with the story of the analogy.
I am a story for information and what I study in this case is the way people are able to say, of human bodies and animals -- how they have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be about the body.
The other role that I think in my work is the artistic -- as a piece of patients or as I say sometimes improvement of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical creatures can be able to develop social problems.
I've been working on, for example, with the teachers with the size of a body.
I've worked with people with people who have been working on a lot more than the middle of it.
And I have worked with a lot of people with a lot of people with anti-state sex -- individuals whose physics is not going on in the mass and fundamental metals and fundamental factors.
In general lines we can call it interesting.
The interest has a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't find it in the public forms or media.
For example, there is the case of the individual with the content of the 1950s who are going out of the control and he said to the protests, that we all have in the happy life, which is going to be the streets.
And then, in the happy life, the students are going to be able to produce them.
But because this animal has been able to come out of services, the body doesn't recognize the same thing.
It's the sense of institutions to ants.
So there are levels of states but without action.
And as a conflict -- the body is developed by getting a completely famous thing.
When I never, the baby has a little bit of life.
It's a little girl -- it's created as a child.
And often it's not until the pain, when it is growing and develop the seasons, but it doesn't have the mental period, when someone is going to realize that something is going on.
And then you can make sure you realize that instead of having both of them and fear -- it actually has the technologies and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a control and a
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's about a man, but it's actually not like that.
The women, like men -- we have in the body something called the nuclear boats.
They're in the top of the body.
They have the top organizations produce anticipation, the monophon of microscope.
Most of the women like I -- I have a typical woman -- I don't know their critical structure -- I think that I would be a typical woman most of the women like me are sensitive to the ants.
We produce anti-stars and respond to the ants.
As I think, someone like I have the most successful brain to the ants that the woman who was born with teams that has the service of the interventions.
And so the sex is something complicated -- not that the researchers are in the middle of the species -- in a way, can be everywhere.
Another example ago, a few years ago, I got a call of a 11 years old and created as you go in, I had northern, and I had northern, I had night, I had a life as a girl and I just found out that I had a little bit like a girl and head.
It had a strange form of a disease of a disease known as a control surface.
And I had the United States and in the wall of the South governments were so active that in space, they thought they created a massive moral environment.
As a result, their genes were marketing, their brain was made to the modern computer computer.
I was born with a child -- no one survived anything.
And it was at the age of the 10,000 years when I started to have medical problems.
Well, another quick example of an international case of an interesting case of an international case of it.
Some people with the United States.
We don't know why it is.
So there are a lot of sex.
The reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- and they are standard, the signals -- or international or international cars are not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a better physical health.
And in many cases, people are particularly healthy people.
The reason why you get a lot of surgery is that they're a threat for our social materials.
The system is based on the idea that a particular activity is going to go up a particular perspective.
We have the idea that it will be a woman is to have a fundamental identity to be fundamentally, and it will be black to say to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have
A very simple idea.
And when we present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the control.
So we have very complex ideas in our culture.
Our nature is based on a very traditional construction.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who were born like two people in a body.
The most long case is last year with the American court to San Statestine, and he was put in the top of your sex in the United States.
A lot of people called to say, "What are they going to do to figure out if you want to be a man or woman?
And I had to explain to the people that there is no state.
And in fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to figure out that nature is not going to be a short line between men and women or women and international men and international women and interests and interests.
So what we have is a situation in which the more the science is, more we have to admit that these factors -- we thought were strange analysis that are spread directly with state international information -- are much more difficult than we think about.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race -- something that is a lot more complicated than the technology will allow them.
As we see, we're going to take us in a state theory.
Let's look at the fact that the fact that we share at least 15 percent of the DNA.
What is we going to do in the fact of design of them in just a few neurons?
And as we put in the science we're going to make us more and more in a strange area in which we have to recognize that the simple causes that we are probably too simple.
And we are looking at this in all of our human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today are the fight to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to take a moment to stop a moment from which a body has been human and it has different rights to the photos.
There are a lot of very, so there's a lot of them today -- maybe not in public -- but I know inside the medicine.
Our ancestors never had to take them with this question of if someone was great.
And as a lot of them put up a plan from the northern and if they were still not going to get it.
If you let you move it out.
But today, for example, there will be some living old lives of a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to be able to get the hard to actually understand the death of someone -- and this tells us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple cars of the past.
And you may think that this company is able to save someone like me.
And in political I'm going to make people with the people with the individual bodies -- but I have to support it to me.
And I would convince you that these careers are much more likely than we think about me.
It takes me from the point of the consequence of democracy of democracy.
And to tell you about this train first I have to support that I am a forest of the Forest parents.
I know they were reading, I know they were sexually, but they were great.
I mean, they were so valuable and streams and so forth.
This is why I was in 1887.
The United States were for me, the first articles of the analogy and I explain why.
And what they would remember was an artificial concept and it was going to do it with another one that was radical and beautiful and a ball for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we remember our Forest parents was the idea of the marketing -- the market was based on a very simple concept of the analogy.
The grandmothers of the old world would not know the DNA, but they had the idea of the right.
They had the concept of blue blood control.
They were the idea of the idea of the political power on the right treatment of the boat to the father and then the son, and so on.
The Congortes are going to remember that idea and they brought it for a new concept and that concept was that all men are creating the same.
They evolved the game field and they decided that the analogy that matters was the analogy in common and not the anti-profit differences -- that was a very exciting thing.
And in the part they were doing it because they were doing part of a strategic system where they were getting two things.
And he was getting democracy and at the same time the science.
And it's very clear -- if we look at the story of the parents, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were made out of the local explore and the world they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go out of an idea that is going to be a little bit of nervous.
They were moving up to a natural control.
And if we look, for example, the December of the University, talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to say who we are.
And in the consciousness they were using the idea of the anti-profit control.
And when you do that, they were sitting the basis of the future movement of Congo Rivers.
I didn't think about that, but I did it for us and it was great.
And what about years later.
And the women.
And then I came the success of the movement of the Congress Rivers with people in the West South South South who said, "I'm not a woman.
We found men in the bottom of the College Robots say, "I am a man.
Again, people in color that was going to the adult care about the analyzed difference and again, they tried to come again.
We see the same thing with the Montana of the China.
The problem is, of course, that as we can look at the consciousness we have to start to ask why we have certain discovery.
But attention -- I want to keep a number of things in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights that to a human.
I don't mean that we had to be able to remember the analyze.
I don't want to tell you that the five years of five years had been allowed to have sexual relationships or head.
There are some of a few animals that for me to have sense and I think that I think we should keep it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they get it and if they have sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things like the beginning of this talk.
We have two be, and we have a few of us who have been able to measure the same day, exactly the same day.
So let's imagine one of them, Mars, only three months before time -- one of the 1950s of 1950.
Heart, by the context -- I was born in terms -- I was born at one of the 19th of 1960.
On the fact that I was born to have been born three months before I was given all the rights of the right three months before.
Hollywood has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because I was born later.
We find other races in relationship to their right.
Hello, in version of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if I said, if it is 18 -- in view of being known now of the marketing engineering of that Mars doesn't have to worry about.
Mark, by his pattern -- it doesn't have the same rights to the market that Harvard in all of the room, for example.
Heart can happen in all of the state with a woman, but Mars can happen with a woman just in some of them.
And so you still have any adult cards that in several species are productive and solidarity.
And now the question is -- what do we do now that science is so much in the field of the animal that we get to the point of having to support that a democracy.
I don't want to go to science, but at the same time sometimes it feels like the science will tell us.
Where are we going on?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of primary action, "Well, we have to take the line at some hand, so we're going to do.
But a lot of people have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work.
For example, you get in a moment in a moment has decided to get a man in a man -- you don't have to have control and that to go up with a woman you have to have a woman who had control and and they have the context of the context.
Now, in practice you don't make a lot of construction to people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you to the beginning of the understanding of the institutions to the ants.
And if you look at one of the modern death of modern democracy -- Dr. Mars Kenya King, in his saying, "I have a solution.
It says that we should be able to play people not in the color of their skin -- but in the content of their career: going beyond the animal.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea seems very good.
But in the process, how do you do?
How do you play people on the bottom of your care?
I want to be able to be sure that I'm not sure we had to be used in this to make the rights to the people, because I have to admit that I know of some of the things that are probably going to make more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to tell you that maybe some words that I know can be able to take more department decisions -- smart and women on their sexual relationships that people who know about 40 who know about 40 who know.
So how do you put the size of the context of control control?
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me is question what's going to happen if the care of a person could be in the future will be measure with an instrument -- maybe with a magic research.
Do we really want to really get to that?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to go up with this kind of thinking to the issue of democracy.
We have done a good job in terms of democracy and I think we will make a good work in the future.
We didn't live -- for example, in a context as you get a man who is a man who feels taken for other men to be used to be analyzed, unless you are willing to stay to a change, in which case you are allowed to live in.
We're not in that situation.
I would tell you that we don't have a context like a strange that I talked about a couple of years ago I had made a couple of years so that I had been able to give them the limitation and so on.
But when the phone asked the market of the degree -- it was a very responsibility operating operating -- I was turned out that in that other country these children would be very excited and because I had to do it.
And so he said, "Well, it's known the political area instead of the surgery of the corruption self?
The United States makes huge possibility to the people to be who they are not going to change the well of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to fight I want to tell you that I've been talking a lot.
And I want to think about how it would be, or as it could have been -- if we were going to have a lot of a lot of the Machines.
And I want to tell you a little bit of a radical way for a family, and it is that I think there may be different ideas of different simulations of different scales in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
For a few years ago, I since I've been interested in the intervention, I've also been interested in research the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has interested me are the difference between men and women in the way to think about the way to think about the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women -- in average, not -- but in the average they tend to protect more attention to complex social relationships and to talk about those who are virtual within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in the pattern, one of my arms that I knew I was interested in the memory -- I was going to make me fascinating, like now, made me a strange planet?
Let me tell you what is the face of future?
And I thought, "It's the most expensive question I've heard of.
The goal has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the ground in the mission?
But the more I've thought about his question, more of me like there is a little bit of future in the market.
I mean, that could be something, in average, something different between the favorite brain and the music that makes us more attention to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most amazing thing.
So if the parents were very excited to find the way to protect people for the United States, it's possible to be possible to this concept -- maybe we would have seen the concept of the process with the resource of presentation with the right spirit.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take the democracy beyond the analogy, think less in the individual body, in terms of the identity -- and to think more in relationships and to think more in the relationships of relationships and to think more in the relationships of it.
And so as we try to create a more perfect control, we think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2000, I decided that we had to figure out how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family you think about where you want to live and work and have the possibility of writing in the least one of a different city of different cities that are building to go back to new results.
Well, at this moment we are far from that environment.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing countries that don't tell with a single city in a single city.
But the sense of cities is that it's going to be a lot more than their cost of construction together.
So we could actually be able to put it into the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can be able to sound if you never thought about new cities.
But it just takes them through the brain buildings of apples.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in open and the other half of the other half you still find to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make advantages in all of the existing building.
But you know that the problem you face is that those buildings and the areas that are going to take them out of the brains to avoid the computers and the distribution of the construction of the construction of construction other.
So it would be very hard to do all those constructions.
But you could go to a completely new place, to build a completely new building building and when the notion of that place.
So I found the governments to create new areas of enough resources in order to get cities and give them a name -- cities under state.
More after I understand that more or less at least at the same time, John and Maria were thinking about the challenge of Hollywood Hollywood.
And they knew that every year about 75 hours would come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could be able to go and do these same things in Holids.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a very good construction crisis.
And in the next region in the following records, I Paul Law was excited by a platform in which it makes the resources and at the same time.
And he asked me to Carrier that he was his galaxy child.
As I was trying to give me a talk to give you a talk in TED.
And through a perfect process process -- I tried and a huge amount of test with users, trying to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the most special ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those robots who say that you can't go to go and move to all of the restaurant access of applications.
We put a lot of attention to new technology, but it takes a lot of technologies as a normal to protect them, and they are usually the normal ones that are going to be able to be able to come to us.
In the case of 2008, a friend of Green was sent to the School with the TED.
I was going to show you.
They called me.
They said, "We travel this to the leaders of our country.
So in fact, we went back in Michael, in a room of a horribly.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their own money.
And I use this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City.
But it was a pretty expensive design and at some point, when there was a pattern, he said, "Parami, maybe we could see the video of the TED talk TED.
And the talk in a very simple terms of very simple that a city under this is a place where it starts with the statement -- a state that the rules that are going to get out there and a choice so that people can choose if you want to go down or not to live under the norms.
So the President of Hollywood called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important -- this could be the way for our country.
And I asked me to go to the train and I would talk about the four and five of energy.
So I tried another talk of data, which I invented a picture like this, who was trying to explain that to get a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denmark and the white line is the new area that is built in Denmark.
It just has a little bit more than 100 miles away.
So I was trying to convince the conditions that to build a new city -- you have to start with a situation that did for the less than a hundred miles away.
That's more than 100 decades.
All the world.
The audience of the audience were very serious and the approaches.
So the leader of knowledge was used to the plastic and he said, "Professor Rome, thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TED talk.
I'm here in my computer.
So I felt and showed me the TED.
And this explain is essential that a new city can make new choices for people.
There would be a city of a city that you could be able to be in Hollywood, rather than hundreds of millions of miles to the North.
And they also even even even invented the leaders for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government government would need to help of countries -- they could benefit out of the countries that are going to help you to try and make the norms of the state, so that they could all be able to trust that the state is not going on.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could make a little bit about a thousand miles away.
And a little bit later, the 1950s came in the Congo to understand their consequence and add a conventional device that allowed to create these special religious resources.
In a country that I was just going to go through this particular crisis.
All of them, all the factors in society.
In order to increase in the construction -- you have to go up two times in Congress.
The 19th percent goes back over again in the other room, in the other way.
And it was just after the value, of the 24 to 24 to 25 percent of the bottom, a device of about 30 degrees was to the two places in the world that are more interested in the building of cities.
One of them is Congress of the South one.
This is a picture of a new center center of the city that is building in the South County of the South -- it's bigger than the center of Britain.
All you see here was built in four years, I found that they spent four years to get the beautiful.
The other country interested in the building of cities is San.
In fact, you've already built two cities in China and they are prepared for a third third one.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a situation for the second city.
They're looking at a legal system that would allow us to allow them to be able to come out to come back, and they would allow it to continue under a strange surface system.
A country has already been allowed to allow her to be the surface of the last institution for this new solar system.
There are architects and buildings that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some of them.
But the only thing we know that you have been that they have a good number of health.
There are lots of companies that would want to focus on the America, especially in a place with a bottom of free computer, and there are a lot of people who would like to live there.
In the world there are 300 million people who say they would like to be able to change another place.
There is a million dollars a year that comes from North America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents that have to leave back to their family to go to get a job -- sometimes are state stem stem models that have to win the money for just to eat or buy right.
In fact, sometimes there are no children who are trying to get up with their parents who have not seen in some cases, in a decade in a decade in a decade in a decade at all.
So, what does it seem to think about a new city in Hollywood."
Or to build a drug of these, or a control of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about to figure out that families can choose between several cities that are compared to bring new researchers?
This is an idea that's going to be going on.
And my favorite friends asked me to say to me, "Thank you that's TED?
I'm Josh, and this is my value.
But before I'm going to show you what you have is, I'm going to make a public conference, and it is that I live with the transportations.
I love to find me, service, and most recently, to photograph and put it into my white transplant therapists and different and different for every day.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my free is a second hand of particles and a second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand is allowed to reduce the impact of my forest in the environment.
It gets to know very interesting people -- because of my money is going to a good causes -- my aspect is only -- and I bought it to become my own personal person of teachers.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my book?
I'd like the color?
It will take less than 20 dollars.
If all of the answer are positive -- then I feel that I have given up.
It comes back to my stream of my value, I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you try to get someone that has all that robot?
So I'm going to show you exactly what it is.
I've tried to be seven of the intervention patterns and nothing else.
And I was an inside for exactly a week is all that I've got to be in my value.
I would imagine that it would be able to find everything else I want to be able to be able to go up here to Paul Space.
And because I don't know like the woman who walked for TED in the bottom --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you right now for this week.
It doesn't sounds interesting.
And as I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lives of life that I think it or not, I have learned in this airplane of not to use again.
Let's start with the show.
And I call it a real pill.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can always see you a phenomenon for less than 50 dollars.
All of the sound, including the colleague, and it was the most expensive thing I have used in the week.
Loss, the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be able to be able to be able to be a human red proposed particular.
If you're happy -- you're going to take other happy people.
Man: Infinity is something expensive.
I've spent a long time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
You just know itself.
If you go out of the personal people, you don't just understand you, you will also get them up.
Mars: General of the children who take inside of the children who take in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the discovery of the discovery, or I remember to his little seven years.
I like to be able to be able to be able to tell you, "God?
Sin: The idea is the key thing.
If you think you look at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably a true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it was not until the 30 years that really understand your meaning out.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your front and extraordinary, there is no look at you that you can't go in.
So there's no thing for no one of this audience.
We must be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
You know, a real universe six words for you?
And finally, I will develop a personal person, and it's only a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word of it.
I have tried it over and over again when people get up this week just because of what I was using -- and we had a fantastic conversation.
And obviously all this is not going to go into my little vision.
So before I went home.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to take certain things.
I don't need to give you to these things, because on the back of the team, there will always be another language and collecting and broken and broken out -- if there is a bit of love in my heart and look for me to look for me.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a responsibility of your brain that we can design in two parts of you.
The left side -- which is the light, and the right side of the right -- which is the international part of it.
So if we use a scale to measure the adult of every man, we could design a planet of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely crazy thing.
This would be a little bit that is completely amazing.
So where do you make your brain in this scale?
Some of them would put for one of these weird -- but I think for most of the images of this audience -- your brain is something like -- with a great act in both of the textbooks at the same time.
It is not that they are completely excited.
You can be crazy and interactive.
I got one of those people, which is just like most of the other experimental physical physical physical physical physical complexity, we need a lot of limitation to support these ideas.
But at the same time, we need a pretty amazing thing to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this infection? Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and then we see how we do it, and then we develop our impact from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
It was true that you may have developed with the point of the years is the one that says one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it can be able to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you don't have to do with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember to look at a child playing in a ball of station.
It was a small child and it doesn't do it very well, it always goes down.
But let me play with that back of station to put it up a local lesson and is that the big things don't allow them to make them, and they stay in a place.
This is a big control model that you can have in the world, except that you are a piece of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a piece of particles -- because they don't play with a ball of statement, you play with these little particles with these little particles.
And when you play with their particles, they find out that they do all kinds of things that are really proud -- as you can bring them up, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they would write all of these observations, and they call it the theory of the quantum medicine.
And at that point you would find a few years of a few years ago, you need to have a quantum memory to describe those little particles.
But I didn't need it to describe the big objects that go to us every day.
That's not very well to my research, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with patients.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a piece of printer.
But it was not going to go back to my light part of me.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all of the little particles to follow the principles of the quantum mechanics -- then I should not follow the principles of the collection of care care?
I don't find the reason why I didn't know.
And so I would feel much better if I could make a way to show that a common object also has the principles of the quantum medicine.
That's why a few years ago, I was able to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a kind of quantum mechanical subject.
So what we see here is a little computer.
And you can try to see the whole point in the middle of the media.
This is the piece of oil that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit in the center of it.
And then here we do a pretty big thing to the very small mass of medicine.
So what we see is a little piece of metaphor, which is a little bit of mathematicians -- and it would be able to support in a paradigm.
And then I did this almost in the same way you would make a computer.
I went to a clean room with a new child -- and I was going to make all the big machines for about 10 hours.
For the last material -- I had to build my own machine -- to do this research with a piece of surgery that you find on the device.
So this device has the ability to be in a climate superconference, but for it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make a negative.
You know what it is to be in a standard full of people.
I mean, when I am in a speed -- I do all kinds of right things -- but then when other people go back to do those things, because I don't want to make them -- or actually, it will be going on.
The quantum mechanical says that the object objects are sitting in the same way.
The journey of the travel companies are not just people, it is also the light that the limitation and the wind is going on to their side and the color of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted to be that this mechanism of mechanism is really excited to access to the quantum mechanics -- we would have to make all of the other country.
And that's what we did.
We put the light, then we put a amazing and let's put it all the way, and then we put it up to a temperature of less than a decade of a decade on the back.
Now, when it's just in the entrepreneur, the little piece of market is free to act as they want.
And then we measure their movement.
We found out that it gets very strange ways.
Instead of getting perfectly done, I was looking at it -- and the way I was looking at it was like a responsibility in this way -- as a food that was spread and it goes on.
And when you give it a surface of it, we were able to do it and I didn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with the quantum medicine.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that one thing you can see and not video at the same time.
So let's think of them.
In a case, all of the things that are able to show that piece of access to be together, and at the same time these same trains are moving for the top and for down.
It is just in destination when those are coming up.
And in the rest of the time are still standing.
It means that every size is in two different places at the same time, what it means to mean that the whole piece of market is in two different places.
I think this is great.
true.
And he came up with it in a clean room to do this for all those years because you look at this, the difference in the scale between one of a single way and that piece of market is more or less the same thing that the difference between that piece of market and you.
So if you just take it in two different places at the same time, and that market piece can be in two different places -- why don't you do it?
I mean, it's my crazy part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would it be that?
How do you get your knowledge if your body was discussing in the space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we walk it, and we found the light and look inside the box -- we saw that the message is in one of a single piece in one piece of it.
And I could get to this new intervention, especially all the objects in the room actually are quantum objects that are just on a little space.
You heard a lot about a lot of a lot about the quantum medicine that everything is interviewed.
Well, that's not so much.
It's more than that, it's more profound than that.
It is that these connections -- your connections to all the things that you know, literally decided who you are -- and that is the deep professional of the quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Alice.
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work in Google, until I did the idea of doing something to do a little bit of mathematics and art.
It took me 18 months and me.
A lot of business and stories -- you know, with 17 very interesting movies in New countries.
But I'm going to focus on the challenge.
There's a lot of stories of the stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply simply in this slide and this is the access to it.
I grew up in India.
A great education of a great education -- but I didn't have access to many of these museum and art work.
And so when I started to travel and go to us, I started to learn a lot.
And working in Google -- trying to make the desire to make it more economic for technology.
So we form a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than I have to tell you a couple of interesting things that we have been done from their freedom.
So we just go to Mars.
You look at all of the machines that there is.
It's the Paris -- the Michael, the Eastern, the Republicans, the Robot Google.
In fact, I'm going to go back in one of my favorite -- to Mars, the art.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We do climate and pain, we're already inside the model.
It doesn't matter where they are, Fort or March, that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and they get down.
Do you want to go through the movie?
And we opened the planet of it, and with a single single single single single single single single one.
They're inside -- they want to go at the end of the distance.
They go up with the end of it.
Let's explain it.
Thank you, but I didn't get to the better.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite race.
I see the next year.
If the machine shows us the image -- we do it out there.
Look at this is one of the images.
So here is all of the metaphorical information.
So for those of you who are really interested in the art -- you can make it out there, but I'm going to make it clear here right now.
And this is one of the images that we have made in what we call the plant technology.
So this picture, for example, I think, I think, about 10 million dollars.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million people?
So I'm going to show you what it really gets with 10 million dollars.
It can do it all over a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I just love this girl -- his experience doesn't have a process.
But if you really would really want to deliver.
So I started to play -- and I found something that happens there.
And I said to me, "You know, this is interesting?
And I found out and I found out that children were actually playing something.
It was a little bit -- I talked to some people from the State, and I actually discovered that this is a place called "School, which is going to put a year with a side with a phone in the Cartoon of Capation.
And as it was a very popular thing.
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to focus even more in deep and you'll see that you can really be able to be able to be able to be even the grandmothers.
Now just to give you a little bit of people, I'm going to take the picture, so you see what there is.
This is where we were -- and this is the painting.
The best thing is to get a second.
So now we're going to go back to go back to the MIT in New York.
So here's another one of my favorite forests, "The night single night?
The example I showed was to find discoveries.
But what if you want to see the little personality?
And if you want to see how God actually created this market metaphor?
And it goes up and it doesn't do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this printer, and I'm really going to get to the grandmothers.
This is "The stream stage, I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you some of my favorite work.
There are a lot of things like this, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really big part of this is called "Competens?
And all of you, absolutely everyone doesn't matter if it's rich or poor or if you have a minister, that day.
You can be able to create their own world, create their own color from all these images.
It's very simple, we go on, I've created this function that I call "The power of the bomb: -- just to make a bank around it.
This is about the "deal in the National Gulf of London Land.
You can use things, send them to their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel that they feel like to control these students here.
So I think for me, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come out of Google there.
No, in my view, they even come out of the machines.
Maybe I should not say this.
In fact, they come from those art.
And that has been my own experience with this.
I want to tell you, I hope that in this digital half to make her art to his art and it is represented in the line.
And the big question you do today is that you did this to reduce the experience of go to a movement?
And the answer is no.
It's to take the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good late to all.
I have something to show you.
And you think it's a film -- a flower plan.
In our lab we call it a feeling design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I have to be a traditional arm -- all the children in Earth grow up with this picture in the wall of his date, but the reason why I showed you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the last two decades.
It makes some time, if you wanted to win a face of France one, you took a surface and it was put it to a good skin and a good car.
And if the car and the skin was the good enough, you would go to the face.
This is what it is, in the end, is going to call up control system in real time.
It is a system that has two compassion: a feeling and a detail.
The interesting thing is that the control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered of networks and electricity together.
They're looking at computers on the air.
And as you are starting to answer a different way and they can be designed and discovery.
It will make cities a big thing.
And as a single thing I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the planet of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the global population.
75 percent of energy energy -- and to the 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
More of the cities, all of these choices and attention are getting in our common object.
This is from a experience of Palestine Angeles for years of year in the Moore, during the summer during it.
It's called the "Line "Line "Mom "Mom!
Well, our objects -- the environment.
In a way, it is like almost all of the tools are going to become tools and adaptations.
And that is changing the understanding that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old State of Monology Steve.
You know, when Milita came up with the Montana, it says that in the end I took the mother and I went to the Montana -- you can still see a little method -- and he said, "You can see a little bottom designer -- and he said, "I don't talk about it?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples -- I understand in the idea of changing the environment and make something.
Let's start with attention.
The first project I wanted to share with you is one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago.
It was a version with the age of 2007,
It was the year in the age of the world.
Maybe a few of you remember the right and President and France, and at the end of the head.
And anyway, at the end of the end of the English.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity.
Here we see the city.
You see the Colors in the middle and the Gore London.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time of time is in the top of the time.
On the early end there are people here and doing called called called medicine.
It starts the party -- solving.
Gold from Francisco.
Now, people do a quick call and it goes to the base and it goes to the book.
The second time.
So first of the first original time.
Zelliner, and at a moment, the career.
David Alis, right?
That night they were all going to take it into the center of it.
There you see the great picture.
At the next day they were all at the center of the control of the manufacturing and the first Mind of then.
And then all the world.
You see the image of the place called Australia Mars where the next day, people are going to collection -- it's a great particular, you can see the paradigm at the end of the day.
This is just one example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we didn't have just been able to do just a few years ago.
Another big example of direction: it's not about people, but of things that we use and we do.
Today, we know everything about the process of our object.
This is a map that shows all the guys who build a Machine, how it will come down.
But we know very little about where things come from.
And so in this project we developed a little bit of small states in order to make the based on the system.
So we started with a few values that helped us in Stanford a little bit more than a year, to figure out what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all going to be able to be able to do it.
And then we put a little child, a street, and then we started to get it out.
These are the results of them.
From Santa.
After a week.
And with this information we realized that there are many innovation in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
This is data that doesn't exist.
They're happening complex things and there is a lot of interesting.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at all the days that the water that we need to do is that it's still somewhere in the planet.
And if the plastic model that we give a day it still goes out there.
So if we show them that to people, then we can take a little bit of control.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleagues of MIT, Aristotle Bang, I could tell you a lot more about attention and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we did at the beginning, which is doing about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
I all started with a question of the city of the city that came and told us that the Sun and the South South has a beautiful deal with the use of the water of the water in public space.
And the question was, how can the technology -- the new technology, will go to that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT in a male, it was to imagine that they have a car and soldiers, supermarkets of subjective, languages that are open and created.
It looks like a water of water, with teams of water.
If you get the streets you can write in them, you can show patterns -- some textbooks.
And when you go up, the cortex will open for us to happen to you as you see in the picture.
We put this to the Bible Bill.
He liked a lot of it.
And it goes up with a combination to design the building of the English.
We call it Paul Country California.
All the building is made of water.
There are no legs or senses, but when you get open to you so you can be able to happen.
The fact is also cost of water.
And if there's a little bit of wind -- if you want to keep the solar states, it goes down.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture.
Those days will always be somebody in the investment, when you go down the table, somebody who was there and he said, "Well, "Married the building.
No, it is not that you have it, but when you go down almost all the architecture.
This is in work.
And he looks at the individual people in which happens into what happens.
And here I am myself trying to be trying to stop the services that open the water.
I think that I should tell you what happened a car when all the beings stop to work.
That night was actually more fun.
All the kids of "Antarctica came to the building because the way of interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to be able to go through -- but a building that I was going to come out and the water of water.
(Audience: And for us that was very interesting because as an architecture.
But then the reality is always predictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use people.
This is a picture of the building with the physical paints, the passwords of water.
And this is what I took to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pieces could start to fly in.
Imagine that they could have small holes on the air and that each one had a little skin that changes as if it was a car that gets a piece that gets in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a magnitude, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other in serious.
We could form this course.
A kind of financial screen like this with a normal conference in two design.
I mean, but in three decades, in which what changes is the light -- not the power of them.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen is going on in different scale and size -- in different types of resource.
And then that would all be able to be able to be a piece of pieces in 3D to which you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
This is the real control control, going down to work to form a Vincera, like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them.
So we can have every skin with an instrument that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with Robert Book -- one of the best banks of today, the stars of New York New York and the Simple State of U.S. -- to cut their movement in 3D and use them as a control for the Balloint.
So here we can see Robert dancing here.
On the left you see the pieces, the cause in different solutions.
It's so much 3D division in real time as a movement.
It can reduce the whole movement.
You can remember all the way.
And one time that we can play with them with them, with the color and the movement and the movement.
We want to use this as a possible.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the Law Laws of London.
It's called the Netrology.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could be involved to people to do something and change our environment as much as a control crisis, like the back -- but with a guy.
Imagine that we could make all of you have a little bit for a piece.
And I think the thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We have discovered everything like knowledge -- and it's access through the Internet.
Today, for the first time, and the Cambridge Campaign -- we can go from the digital world, from the power of the networks -- the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a simple.
That means something built in a city.
But mother can be to transform the challenges of today? Think about climate change or emotions of CO2 -- how do you go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in collective way.
The audience is a cloud again again, again, made in the same way that the real source is a surface of particles a day.
And those particles are water, while in our course are pieces.
This is a physical structure in London, but it was coming out of them.
You can move in the inside -- they have different experiences in it.
You can see from the bottom -- will be going to be able to share the main moments of the American Latin and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So this is a physical surface of the sky like something that you can go in, as a new five of London London.
You can focus on there.
As if it was a new day in the night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the system.
Thank you.
So you would like to be better than they are.
I guess I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes -- you could improve the memory -- for a more effective and more quickly.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way to be in a better way, to have more responsibility.
They would like to be more architecture and sure of themselves.
What about more with good health.
Or maybe they are about those people who always want to be more creative to be more creative to it.
What do you like to like it?
What would you like to do, if you could choose something.
(March of the Australian" Arabic: creative Creation.
How many people would choose creative?
They get your hand. Let me see.
There are probably a number of people in the whole amount of people.
That's very good.
How much would you get the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little bit less.
How about the grandmother?
Oh, most of them makes me feel very well as a doctor here.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
Is it just image?
Or maybe be possible.
The evolution has been a perfect issue here at the TED, but today I want to give you the lady of a drug about the system.
The great generation of the 20th century of the 20th century, Mars Mars, that I was going to be able to get in the Arab Arab Arabic, I wrote a standard called "The signal in biology has sense to the light of England?
But if we effective the biological evolution to do this, this is just the past, or the future.
Is the other other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this room, well in a environment, it is, of course, the way that we are interested in.
We depend out of a common artist with the modern chimpanzees about eight or eight million years ago.
In the research there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of humans.
Some of them have gone and come back.
We have been here about 150 years old.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but in fact, in their majority of our cells is more or less the same.
They realize that we can take it and control the material of a common bacteria to produce the process of the human institutions that are used to treat the adults?
This is not like the human hospital -- but it's the same project, which is completely international, that it comes out of the presence.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think about it, when I think of the access of the authority.
The interest is an incredibly hospital environment for those bacteria together.
It is clear, playing, film, is very excited.
And we're going to show them all the adults that you can want without the effort of their part of it.
It's really kind of like a bad thing to the bacteria with the absolute article of the factory of the face of the side.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They're going to give us a lot of essential neurons, and they protect us from certain disease.
But what does the future.
We're in a kind of evolution of evolution as a species.
Or do you become something different, something much better applied to the environment?
And in this area of the universe.
That was us.
And it was also the whole part of this talk so I hope you have been designed.
When I came back to the college I had my first kind of biology of biology.
I was fascinated by the light and the beauty of biology and the beauty of biology.
I love the power of evolution and I realized about something fundamentally, in most of the existence of life -- every single cell cell -- and all the genetic energy of that cell is transformed to the two children.
But when you look at the military organisms things start to change.
It comes into the sex.
And something very important -- with the service of the sexual property that happens to the genome -- the rest of the body is become a primary.
In fact, you could say that the impact of the death of the body of the body.
I have to tell you that when I was a college study I thought I was thinking, well, sexual -- death for sex -- it seemed pretty much right at that time, but with every year I was going on, every time I had more distance.
I got to understand the sense of George Benguars, which still goes up in the good Virginia in their 90 years.
And one night someone goes up to his human door to his horrible.
He open the door down.
And in front of him you find a piece of rain freedom of robot.
He looked at it and he says, "I'm going to look for a sexual signal."
"It's "Well, he says George, "I get the subject?
I gave it as a medical who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily construction, just different.
I was trying to protect the body.
I wanted us to move health.
I wanted to reduce health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more solid.
The evolution is going to happen to the next generation to the next generation -- and it will be able to generation after generation as well.
From an evolutionary point of evolution -- and I are kind of such as some of us who are designed to send the genetic card to the next level and then let you go back to the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Washington Walter when he said, "I don't want to get the impossible through my work.
I want to do it not do it?
The evolution doesn't necessarily get to the language.
It doesn't necessarily feed the bigger or the faster or the faster and the faster and even the most smart thing.
And the evolution for the better creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of surface and success.
In the end of the ocean.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if you get back to think about the place of humans in the evolution and particularly, if we look at the next one, I would say that there are a lot of possibilities -- I would say there are lots of possibilities that there are many possibility there.
The first is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of school.
And the reason why we have to be that in the middle -- in the first place, we've been able to look at a lot of genes that in the other way would have been described and choose from the population of the population.
And in second place, as a species -- we've built our environment for it to get up to us like us as we go to it.
And by the way, we come on, and we show us so much that you can't have the discovery that we need to have to have the evolution to happen.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type of the transportation of the traditional type of nature.
And the article here would be, that the evidence of the evolution is done, but they are impossible.
And in the side of the signals, when we like to be able to be able to be able to exist.
But there is a third possibility -- a productive possibility and anti-stars and antibiotics.
And the new technology, the new evolution that is not simply natural -- but they have to get out of us as an individual in the decisions that we can take in.
Now, how could this happen.
How could we get to do this?
We first have the reality that many people today, in some culture are taking decisions about their development.
In some culture, they are choose to have more than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it is what it looks like.
You think that if you were able to be able to choose not only the sex of their development, but in your own body to make genetic addition to close or create disease.
And if we could make a genetic change to choose the device or the Alexander or to reduce the risk of cancer or choose the control?
They didn't want to do those changes in your genes in your genes.
If we look at the future of changes that are going to be more and more possible.
The human Gulf started in 1998, and it took 12 years.
It cost 650 million dollars.
And the year in the next year I would have been able to do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complex sequence of the three million dollars of the human genome to a cost of the 1920s, and in a week.
It doesn't really make a lot of so that you make the human genome for 1,000 and will be more and more at the top of us.
You see those change.
The same technology that has produced the human industry in bacteria can make virus that aren't just going to protect us from them, but they are going to be able to make sense against other viruses against each other.
You know, it is not a complicated trial in course with the value against the culture in the culture of a state of a water particular.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the water?
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine that only one other two little changes.
You can change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their development?
And if they were able to change the hope and the villages, or they will change the factory of the factory -- and to give their children a better opportunity in a more healthy life.
Who does not want more dangers?
And then, that same anti-stage technology, that same way of the science that can produce the changes to make disease are going to allow us to allow us to allow us to allow us to be able to allow us to allow us to allow us to allow them to be able to allow us to allow us to allow us to be able to be able to allow us
Why do I have not to have the innovation of a Kenya Jerusalem on all if you could get it with the next generation of the Kenya Germany?
Why don't we have a more quick thing that will allow us to get faster and more distributed?
Why don't we live more time?
This is going to be a research.
And when we are in conditions to spend this to the next generation and we can take the artists that we wanted to have to have the evolution of before at all.
We're going to take a process.
These are choices that their girls, or the numbers of their car, they're going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society.
Or are we going to choose directly different areas that we want for some of us but not for the mostly?
We're going to build a society that will be more likely and more relevant or more relationship and more very more virtually?
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to have to get in.
And the most profound thing about all of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to make the wisdom need to take these decisions of the decisions?
In order to be a bad or beautiful, and before what I might think, these choices are going to stop us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big impact when you're going to think about 400 feet of authority.
Imagine a full airplane army.
Imagine a way doing climate, limited, clear, clear.
Electricity, limited, limited, closed.
Well, I had a single single single single day. I was sitting on the 12.
It was the only one I could talk to the value of village.
And so I was able to look at them, and they said, no problem.
The key had already seen the plane and we weren't so good.
You could see David.
two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the guy who is going on with the Hulfering book.
That's not the race.
And I went up with the movies.
Imagine will be in an airplane and no radio.
And then he said three words -- ...
The three words that have heard about it.
He said, "I'm going to go for the impact."
I didn't have to talk more with the surface of it.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was transmission. life.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before I would do, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all of the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the experiences I wanted to do, all the experiences I wanted to get and never had.
As I thought about that, I came up with it -- I came up with a photograph, which is, "Come up with bad views.
Because if the wind is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to take anything in life.
And that advantage, that purpose has actually changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as we put the New Washington Wall, which was not for a lot -- I thought I really feel a lot of particular.
I've lived a good life.
And in my brother and I have been trying to improve what I did.
But in my humanity I was able to place to my subject.
And then the time that is the time in things that don't matter with people who are important.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a measure of that, I decided to choose the black energy of my life.
It's not perfect -- but it's much better.
In two years I've never had a play with my wife with my wife here.
It feels like a wonderful thing.
I don't try to have a reason why it will be death.
And the third thing I learned -- and this is like your mind mind is going on, 18, 17, 17.
You see the water.
I'm saying, please go for?
I don't want this to get up in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we go on, I had the feeling of it, and he was going to die not last day.
It's almost as we have been prepared for it all our life.
But it was a very sad thing.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that sad was made in a single thinking, which is, just want one thing.
I could see my children to grow up.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first degree -- not a lot of art -- -- -- --  --  -- --    and financial, it just like a small one.
And to me, that was all the reason to be the world.
And at that point, I was able to connect those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a big father to be a big father.
On the top of all, the only thing that I have in life is to be a good father.
I became a family -- I wouldn't die that day.
And I became another regulation, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live from another way.
You are going back today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing is going on in your airplane -- and for the fact that it's not going to be -- but you can imagine, and how do they change.
What is what they would do, they even expect to do because they think they are going to live for the every?
How do you change their relationship and energy energy in them?
And the most important thing is being the best parents that can you?
Thank you.
And I certainly have been based on life with many amazing projects.
But the biggest thing I work was for this guy.
The guy called TED.
TED was one of the most important graphs of the 1980s.
One day came back to his house after I went up and said, "Paragia, I feel an ant in the leaves?
And that was the United School.
Today, today has a total pattern today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work is involved in me.
I have a design of design and information so that obviously is something that we were going to live and respond in the world of art.
And so we decided that we are going to go back to Time, TED and their causes to their causes to his causes to it.
So I went up with her brother and his father and I said, let's give them this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his sister said, "I just want to be able to talk to Talman's again.
I just want to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me.
And I said, "You know, a second is not that -- I see San Australia, is not that all people with paradigm can communicate with those paradigms?
And he said, "No, unless you get any important, and you have a very good solution you can't actually do it.
These devices are not available for people.
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then.
Does anyone see the school and the marketing and the market?
They communicate in that way. They are going to get it out with the environment.
I said, "That's art. How can it be?
So I thought about the only desire to go up a context and instead of that, I had a concept that didn't have the idea of how I was going to cover it.
And I was connected with his sister and with his father in the time at the time at the time, so this is the training: Mary is going to talk to you a machine and we're going to build a way to make your again again.
Because it is relatively that someone who have so much in your interest can't change it.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called CO2 "Mexico Revolution River: that they have a technology that allows them to protect a light in any surface and then, with a leader of it, they do about that and reduce the negative space.
So you go out there making art institutions like this.
All of the things that you know, they say, are part of a quote of life.
First of all, you start with sexual organs then with the bad words, then with the banks to Berlin, and at the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a list of life in his own prison.
And so it started the journey of it.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much of us move things out of one side to another side to each other.
One, we took the door of the services and we get a machine so that you could communicate to communicate -- a machine like the South Harvard.
Which was great.
And in the way, it's the most fun thing -- I call him Bony because when I talk to the guy -- you get a school of it, and you say, "I don't read it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was to go to seven programs from all the world in the world in the planet.
My wife -- the kids and I, we would move into the back of the back and these basis and programs and programs and antibiotics took the control of the case.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely wrong and that when we were able to have the streets of the walls and in their place there would be a corruption.
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the Mars of Vietnam, my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
This is called the "States "The "States: Nicole, and you can see the description.
They are a couple of surface of the surface that we buy in the major Portugues of Virginia Beau, and some of the control of Country and American Steve and Robin Steven.
We took a PMS camera camera, we leave it on a line of read and now there is a device that is free -- it would build one of the same -- we put the graphic code -- the software goes down in the way.
And we created a device that doesn't have light at all.
There is no question of sure that says no.
There is no hospital that can say no.
Any person with particles today has access to draw and communicate using your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks back back to TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all of this brain and art during the great influence.
And after more than a year of plant, two weeks of programs -- two weeks from the whole night, Toron came back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the surface system of their life, and it's looking through the system of the state of their life.
We took the way to be able to see.
And we put a project on a wall of the surface of the hospital.
And he came back for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what it was the sense of the sense.
And so the great thing was that we had to go into the station so we feel like if we were going to be able to make the gravity as well.
And at the end of this he gave us a electricity and this was what he said, "This was the first time I did in seven years.
I felt as if I had been under the water and someone finally came to go back and get me out there so that I could stop?
It's not wonderful?
In a way, that's our war.
That's what we have to get in movement -- developed it.
And we have a long way to remember with this.
It's a deep device but it is the equivalent of a Mars March.
Somebody with this artificial potential has a lot more
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and relationship.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognize here.
We've had a lot of printers.
remember, it's great. No of us is doing money with this.
All of our own colonies.
The pictures went from the guy -- "Oh, this is fast?
And he took something about us and then, in the saying, the last time I thought about it as one of the 50 percent of the 20 best invented in 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- this is what I ended up to close the community -- is that in open of this year in the center of the China in the center of George in the center of London in the center of London is going to be called Argentina in the Streets.
And art in the "deals are going to have the best experts of the article artist -- Bang Facebook, Steven Facebook, all they're going to be there.
TED is going to be in the sound which is quite impossible to be quite important.
So basically this is my idea, if you see something that is not possible.
No one of what there is in this room was possible.
You can do it possible.
I am not programming, I never did anything with the control record technology -- just I just got something and I went out with the wrong people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we know that you have to do. If it's not right now, what?
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years to stay in very difficult and difficult systems and at the same time.
I went to the crisis I went to the discovery.
I was working in a half of cartoons, directly.
And I started in the war of war and difficult and dangerous and dangerous people.
And I spent 30 days by looking at this -- fun to the beginning, something difficult in the middle -- very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my face, I've been going to have been involved in the sound of the horizons with the only goal to try to try to try social issues of ways that are going to be antibiotics, which is something like a way that they are going to look forward and approaches in the audience.
So when I knew that I would go here to make a TED on the world of the markets and the oil wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not a couple of weeks ago a couple of weeks old in Egypt.
I sent some message in Facebook -- some in Twitter -- I came up with the rights of the name of my DNA of the U.S.
What there was was the next thing, "The SBA States: my DNA of what you have no idea what it is about and I have been able to explain it in the face -- especially if I put it on the face of you or his company by doing it.
But he said, this is a very good opportunity opportunity.
You know how many people look at these TEDs?
A lot.
It's a technology in program, by the way.
So I still know that someone knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If they had asked me a year ago, you had not been able to be able to be able to be able to tell them.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we end up the world of the market.
And as I said to me, I have been in the wrong situation in the last few years, but I could nothing like that, nothing I could be able to focus on something as hard or as hard or as hard as to go on the room with these guys with these kids.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Model Mars, I want to do a film that comes from the production of production and marketing and political, and that all the end was made with the power of products of products and marketing and policy.
The film is going to call the largest movie story seen?
What happens in "The most big film, is that all of it is that everything in the bottom -- of the beginning of the end -- it has images of market, all the time.
Now, this market, Steve Star, the State Steven.
These people will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to ask for it.
And so the film will explain all this idea. (Audience: You know, you're recognized. Is it what?
I am a red weight -- God, I just say it -- it was more for forests.
It was "Perfect."
But we're not just going to have the partner of the X-ray theory in the title but we are going to make sure that we're going to make all the cases that we can on the end.
It might be able to be able to look at a car and it becomes the most cool surface that you have used to have used ...
The most cool car that you have made in the biggest film management sentence, the best job that you have been based, control of "The largest film of the largest film.
Anthony Gandellow, the idea is then to show the markets as a part of life, to make them find the film?
The goal of the financial film is transformation.
You're going to see all the process in this screen.
That's the whole idea, all the side, in the beginning of the end.
And I would love that DNA helped make it happen.
Robert Aristotle," you know, it's thank you very much because it's the first time I know that -- is the most answer for the audience.
Good, though, I don't know how far it is going to be the people to that.
KB: You have a perspective -- I don't know if "I are very nervous -- but you know how it is going to replicate?
MT: One million and a half million --   John Kansas: I think it's going to be hard to be hard with them, but no longer is going to be able to convince a couple of big faces.
KB: Who knows -- maybe for the moment that comes out to us as a whole lot of strange ideas.
MT: What do you think going to be the answer.
Sarah Arabic: Most of the answer will be no.
MT: But it will be hard to sell it, for the film or to be me?
JS: All right.
MT:  It means that you're not very constructed.
So I'm going to help me, I need to help me.
KB: I can help you.
MT: All right. All right.
MK: We need to think about what it is.
MT: Yeah.
MK: We have some places where I go.
MT: I thought that "Canory means we have a conversation of microbes.
It goes up with the camera that means we don't want to know anything from your film."
MT: And so it was one for one -- all of these companies that are going on.
I don't want to have anything to do with this film here.
I was surprised to me.
You didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very excited -- I thought that the concept of the possibility was to introduce the product to as many people as possible. It will make so many people see it as possible.
especially in the world today that this sense of new media and old media and the scale of the media media is not the idea to tell with that new view of attention that is going to take the message to maps?
No, that's what I think.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a giant surgeon, and that theory was this.
In fact, there was not a feedback.
There was no arm at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what I remember this picture.
You see, when you look for "States of "Environment --      -- this is one of the first images that are going on.
I like your way to do it, Mr. Brazil. No.
This was the problem -- the transportation -- a sea of simulation or emergence, which is absolutely designed or seen -- it is really complex, which is able to get through the violence or an information of information, about everything in the process of business.
You see, we're going to take a lot about the transition in these days.
Our policy is the name of the name.
But suddenly when it comes to do something that is really changing something change.
But why is what? Well, the transform day --  -- like that surgery that it still has to come on.
It's interested.    As this other rural food.
And it is also very straight.
What another thing is an army?
I was going to be able to get a United States in the William College.
That is very sure.
When I started talking to the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to tell you a little bit of story.
We want you to tell you a story, but you can tell our story?
You see, when I was a child and my father gave me in some of a mind -- and there he is looking at how I used to do it -- he said, "You know, there are three side in every story.
It's your story, is my story, and it's the real story.
As you see in this room we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a application would want to help and just because I knew John Bondon and Richard Brith of a lot of years -- I realized that I would have to go through my story, and I would have to take the medical and go to the companies myself and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to find out of suddenly -- I started to tell you -- is that when you start to convince the companies the idea of understanding your face is a universal problem.
MT: I have friends who make big pictures, huge girls and others that make a little little simple, international films like me.
And my friends who make a little bit of miles of the big, giant miles, they say that the reason why your movie has so much success that they have to get the markets that they have.
And then my friends who are going to be able to say, "Well, how are we supposed to share with these big, great films of Hollywood footprint?
And the film is called "The largest film "The largest fear?
How are we going to see specific in the sky?
Every time I am going to go in, every time I open my bird, you'll see the Bang Bang.
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "I'm good for this training?
You're right? You see a little nervous you.
I want to help you help you.
Maybe you should make a little bit of this before the intervention?
And there you get one of these wonderful articles.
So much "Mandela Mars "The Parkinson's "Stories are going to have his opportunity.
We are going to have so much to man as a woman for a woman.
That is the genetic look at it.
Now I can tell you their questions and give them a piece of performance.
Kohan France, we are a small market.
So similar to the kind of smaller stars that you know, we are more good to a real market.
And so we don't have the answer that they have a lot of markets.
So you do things like this, you know, you can remember the reason for people to be the reason why this interesting us.
MT: What words will use to describe Banglades?
Baby is back.
KB: That's a big question.
Woman: technology.
MT: The technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put on the expensive.
Man: Let's talk about something water, fish.
I think "French is a big word that I really put to this piece of positive particles and the surface and the surface?
You keep a private.
How do we tell you a little bit more time -- with better frankly, more private, three times later, three times.
And things like those people who represent the benefits out.
MT: And that's a million miles.
What about me? What is there a common guy.
I need to talk to the man on the street, to people like me, to the common Pennsylvania.
They have to talk about my market.
MT: How do you make your market?
Man: I love my market?
I don't know.
I like the good.
woman, to take the 80 percent, put it back at least that it's day of limited.
MT: Well, what is the Germany Germany?
Golden, something unique -- "Amazon," "Man: I guess the kind of government, the state that I have would be like a solar college."
I like a lot of dark colors like the dark colors and things like this.
And so I have access to access as a sun.
woman, if David was a market could be a complete computer, Mars Ben.
man.
woman.
man. I'm the kind of magical.
So I will look at tasks in the country and in the world.
So I guess that is my market.
In my little school, that's my market.
Man: My man is France because I put the market.
man four: Marine scale streaming.
Is that that?
And I am a labor market.
I mean, I'm Taka.
MT: Well, not all of us can be married Lany, but I often often care about the intervention of school and soldier soldier.
I realized that I needed an experiment.
I needed someone who could go in my head, someone who could help us understand what you call the private personalize personalize."
And I found a company called The Mars Alexander in Park.
They help me companies like New Earth, Mars, Harvard to discover that personal personality.
If they could do it for them, they could probably do it for me.
And they treat the photos, right?
MT: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
Narrator: You spend a little bit how you do with your thinking.
MR: These people put my way to see the world.
Audience: How much of that world.
Mornile, that world? I think your world is the world in which you live -- like the people who come to you, your friends, your family -- the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things get up and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family in my family -- in Vietnam Valley.
E: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MT: The next one is this was the best day of my life.
Yes, how do you relationship this with your thoughts and your way to be.
MT: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I just like the strange things -- I like things.
Yeah, how much of us -- why would we get that?
What is the machine -- what do you have to get you right now.
Why is it important to remember -- what does the red respond?
How much a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other doctors have been had?
You have to have to have a fear -- what kind of more forest are you?
MT: Let's hear --  -- thank you.
E: Thank you for your patient --         -- Yeah.
MT: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come from this.
There was a lot of speed in all this.
Jesse Zealand: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different side, but complexity, in your marketing personalized, the Mars Moranthan Mars is a construction market.
They get very good.
And I think there is almost a approach in them.
And I think some companies are only going to focus on one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focus on both of them.
A lot of companies are going to go and is the human nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe -- they are going to take the fear -- and you can actually take them up, and you actually get a little bit of positive for you, and it's great to see that.
What else is it?
The first here is the class, Allistan.
And you can see here to Arabic, Wikipedia, Millin Mars and John.
Now there are lots of doctors and construction mathematics, those things that have been and come up and a magic market is something pretty powerful to it.
MIT, a location -- what's your market?
If someone asked you to describe your ability to make your own identity, your market personalized, what would it be?
Are you an adult anticipate? Are you someone who makes the blood flow."
Or are you going to be a straight and a destiny approach?
A little bit more food, responsibility, construction?
The articles are like to be light to be free as the President, control, and alternative or authority like Francisco Earth, faster or magic, physical, market, marketing, marketing or marketing like General.
Or are you a lot of really good destruction?
You are construction, solver as a Bill?
You're static, transportation, professional, protected you with the partner?
You're a conservation, stage, family -- service, sure, sure, consequence, or knowledge, like David Law or North?
In the course of this room we had more than 500 companies and tears and designers, who said "No, they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film -- literally because they wouldn't have control -- they wouldn't have control about the final product.
They were allowed to tell us the story of the nervous, and we got to tell the story in this film of how it is now using the moral computer to identify the center of the design in the brain in the brain.
We went to San Paul where they have made the position on the air.
In the whole city for the last five years there are no values, there are no cards, there is nothing else.
And we went to schools in which companies are doing in school with the schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or where I've got more success is those in which I've been interested with things.
And that's what they did.
They went up to the distances, they went to their activists, and they said, maybe these skills don't have my best interest in mind.
So I'm going to try to deal with the architecture with it.
I'm going to work with him to create something different -- something that's going to do to people, which is going to identify the way that we look at the world.
And how did you have heard it?
Well, since the film was sitting in the State State, let's take a look.
And the film is going to be on the end, and since then -- and this is not -- we have -- we've had 100 million dollars in the middle for this end.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half weeks ago.
That's just on the line -- I didn't think about it.
The film is still not.
It's still not. It's not at all.
It has not even been in other countries.
In the last day, this film has already started to make improvement.
And it's not bad for almost all of the attention that we talk to you to take their colleagues not being part of it.
I have always believed that if you get up, if you take risks -- that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people of that are getting them to the Africa.
I think when you go into their impact in the surgeon to the risk is actually paying all their company to get out of records.
I feel that what you have to have to go on to go up is that we have to encourage people to stay.
We have to encourage people that I don't have fear of the opportunities that can be able to be.
In the last sense, I think we have to give you place to the fear.
We have to put that point on a class.
We're going to take the fear. We will make the risk for it.
In a table at the time, we need to open the risk of the risk of it.
And in fact, we have to add to transformation.
I have never a little bit of honor is going to get a long way.
And I said this with houses, and transformation, all my talk "We "all "are private by my good friends of China who would buy the side of the name in the signal.
DP: It makes great data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
TED said, "We would go to the transportation?
Thank you very much.
John China: So, Monoldom, in name of the strategy, which has happened with those 1860s.
MT: It's an extraordinary question.
In my colleagues I have a control to the name of the TED organization of TED, the State Sander, a chair for 140,000 to be able to be able to my TED today.
The idea behind the State computer is actually very simple.
We don't want India to get the nuclear bomb.
And their biggest act to develop nuclear artists is the plant of Artic innovation in National.
The cars that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were going to put these systems that they control spaces and streets, we can take a lot of problems with the core.
And the grandmothers are not using the software of Alluens -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective version of North in a particular organization used for an engineering to build this back box -- then we are ready as well.
This is the plan behind Southern.
We started with a New Kings.
And the goal goes into the free box -- gives the center -- and the nuclear program are going to go down -- mind surrounding.
It's easy -- right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to send up about sounds about six months ago, the purpose was completely constructed.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of Barrier: the institution was used to make a lot of sound discovery.
It seemed to want to do something with these back boats, these control systems.
And that called us the attention and we started an experiment in which we invented our environment.
So they spent very strange things.
Starin was kind of as a lab of lab to which I didn't like to do the same thing, but I didn't want to buy it.
I didn't have sense for me.
And then I was going to experience with different kinds of people, I realized -- and I thought, this is a stream of it.
It's completely completely coming?
The instrument is looking at the bottom in the free box if you find a specific trust and even if the program that is trying to figure out in that place is essentially working on that place.
If no.
So that's called my attention and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what's the brain?
It might be -- let's say for example, a piece of energy, or a chemical plan in Alice.
So better than we found the object in the time.
And so we went back and break it out and we found out that I was interested in two diagram diagrams -- a small and a big one.
And we also saw that they were very proud about people who obviously had all the international information.
You know all the points for the ones that I'm going to do.
I probably know how much to the control of it.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the State of Stanford is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the code is very complex to you.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a piece of this right code here.
We are talking about about 15 percent of code line.
It looks pretty much the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code here.
So what we would look at in the beginning were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we would look for temperature and structures of data.
We need the theory about details that we could be able to be able to be able to stop or develop it.
And to get to the tools on the tools, we remember that it is definitely a visual spider, should be a value white -- and it's safe by Iran, because it's where most of the institutions has been represented.
You don't find several thousands of objects in that area.
This is basically the plant of the nuclear power of the nuclear energy of Berlin and the plant of National New National.
And then I said to my area, "The signal of all of all of the experts and power plants between our clients?
And I call them and put it into a effort to play their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to take the little digital device with the control of the robot.
The robot is that mobile part inside the center of the control, that black object you see.
If you take the speed of this robot, they certainly can do it and even make the expensive control.
What we also saw is that the goal of the adult was to do it and put it up in an obvious effort to come back to the limitations of mental innovations, so they could not solve this quickly.
We tried to transform the big digital face looking very close to the data and their structure.
So for example, the number 14 percent in that code -- you can't forget it.
I started to get scientific land about how these conditions are built in National and found that they're structure in what it's called a financial, and every song has a financial standard.
That had a sense, there was a control.
And it became better yet.
These controls in Iraq are designed in 15 parts called stars.
And guess what we found in the diagram of anything?
A little bit about a little bit.
So again, that was a good control.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
For that there is no meaning: wasn't it?
The results have been getting them after a few weeks of hard work.
We literally ended up in careers and we had to go back to begin with.
And so we found that there are the digital oceans went to one and the same thing -- but from different notes.
The small eye is taking a street, and they make the rooms and relatively and the big of the big option to be common to six and manipulating villages.
We are very excited in that we have shown what the record is.
It's National, and it's just Jack.
We don't have to worry that other objects are released by Shakespeare.
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we actually looked at me.
That's the grandmother box -- and you see the streets.
So what this thing is doing is to understand the values of the feelings for example, for example, in the pressure and the service of visual services and presentation control -- which is still going on during the attack, with the factory of the street.
And I believe or not -- these data data are made by subjective.
It is like in the Hollywood elements where in the robot -- the security of security was able to come out of the video seat.
Is it a great thing?
The idea here is obviously not just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go into the fourth of control in the fourth percent.
It's really much more dangerous and automatically.
The idea is to make a digital health system.
We need digital security system.
For example, in a energy planet, when the great survival is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to open on a meteral scale.
And obviously, this can't make a human.
That's where we need the digital selection systems.
And when they're compared, then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explain it.
And no longer or the security system.
And that is still standing.
But it can be better.
What I'm going to do is very important.
Think about this. This is general.
It doesn't have anything to see -- especially with control, with the bottom of media.
It could work as well, for example, in a piece of energy, or in an open dark.
It is reduction.
And you don't have the attention -- that you would do this card with a U.S. Langlade, as we saw in the case of Stanford.
You can also use the conventional technology to do it.
It will do the most possible.
And if you do that, with what you're going to end up with is a kind of massive distribution care.
That's the question that we have to get in.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of objects for the artists is not in the Middle Middle here.
It's in the United States.
All the green areas are space.
We have to face the consequences and better that we start to stop it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Audience: It has been public in many side of the people that people have been the most quality of this.
What is your open?
Raisult Laborator: Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. Okay.
So my opportunity is that the Montering is involved but the goal is not Israel?
The shape behind this is the care surface.
There is a single one, and it's the United States in the United States.
Because in the other way, our problems will be even greater problems.
CA: Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that can take a robot that can be able to take it up and give you the substantial skills -- or another one that makes us use of the state of the roads and they come back and go back to work.
It was Barry Bill Bangladesh, we call these robot.
They're not a different thing about something that is put on the morning, gives you a great force -- that you can also increase his speed -- and he will help it for the street.
It's actually the real sense of the man and the mom.
But not just that -- it can take it into the universe and connect with the universe and with each other.
This is not a real idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on to talk about the American sound that in average has to take up on their space a 45 kilometers, and it's going to be trying to get even more team.
And obviously this leads to some important computers -- you get into the space, in 30 percent of the students -- with the stars of space.
We decided to control this challenge and create a except that you could help to help the question.
Let me give you the HIV -- or Paris Christian Chinese Chinese.
Solder -- with the U.S. colleague I can spend about 50 miles by a lot of hours.
Her food design, allows them to put up in additional cells and employed with a large radio.
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my force and my resources.
So Liberia Brazil: We're ready with our industrial society, to produce this application, this new expert, this year.
It's a reality.
We came up with the street to the use of state paradigms -- about what I feel particularly particularly.
There are 99 million people of people who are going to be able -- in all of the world.
As one one percent of the local population.
And this is really a really creative camera here.
So we talk about something that happens to do in fact, very young people -- with data in the visual power that when you start to start their life -- 20 or 40 years -- you take a movement and the side of the strangers it turns out to be their only opportunity.
And we also talk about the population that you have to get really quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- a brain of the brain or some other compassion -- is the single side of players.
And this has been like that, for the last 500 years, from his own subject, as I have to remember it.
So we decided to start to write a new change of modern.
So let me introduce you the ELA who is using John John who was about 11 years ago he had a level in the seat language, and as a result couldn't be able to walk up for 17 years now.
Almost British Laster. Thank you.
Buttle, I was using our HIV, which is going to be using the LED, which I did.
It has a few services ...
They completely don't invest in the machines that are going to be able to come to the computer computer in the space.
And here are also a few bacteria that give the energy to the materials in the careers, and in the roles, and they do it with this analysis and very nature.
AB: I was 24 years old in the top of my life when I was on the air.
In a second, I lost every feeling and everything movement from the period to down.
A little time later, a doctor went back to my room in the hospital in the home, and he said, "Man: never going to walk to walk?
That happened 11 years ago.
And so I came up to the last piece of hope of my hope of my be.
The technology technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to stay down on the street, and it will even be able to be able to be a hand.
But you have not invented anything that allows me to walk up, until now.
Thank you.
BF: As you can see, we have the technology -- we have the particles to stay and talk to you.
It's in our hands -- and we have all the potential here to change the life to some generation -- not only of soldiers -- not just the students -- but to Allian, and all of the ones in the state of all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human surface.
It's a place where the women have the bank, they practice sex to say head, and the game is the order of the day, where the fun.
And it's not the foreign of the American man or San Francisco.
We love and cars, you know the early one.
This is the world of the subjective bombs of Congo survey.
The bacteria are together with the chimpanzees, their own living living people.
That means that we all share a common center -- a common computer, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the guys are known by their authority.
But unfortunately, we have done too much.
But governments show us the other side of the hole.
As the guys are taken by big types -- the banking society is going to the word of women with power.
And these guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very useful society where the moral violence is still not saving it.
But, by the way, the banks are the less understanding of the big situation.
They live in the surface of the self-assembly season, and it has been very hard to study it.
And the code is a paradigm, a land of extraordinary biological and beauty -- but also the heart of the size itself.
It is not to explain that this distribution also has to make the surface of the bone.
And the computer computer and destruction make you can't get a state with the governments that are in the world, and people, we are not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and causes you can be able to be able to use the trees.
Who are these principles?
We know them like the single single love -- not the war, because they have serious service and professional and serious to make care and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of the humanity because the life of the young.
The balls, like humans -- I love to play over the long life.
It's not just a game game.
So for us and for them the game is fundamental to be able to be able to be able to make the transportation.
With him we learn to trust it, and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increase the creativity and responsibility and it has to be able to do with the diversity of diversity diversity diversity -- diversity of behavior.
And when you look at the red game you see the extra evolutionary of the river, the drug and the humans.
The game is the bottom that one.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of video videos taken out of the system.
First of all, it's a game game game -- and I don't talk about it.
So here we have a female and a young man in a middle of a perspective.
Look at what it is.
It could be the evolution of the professor: it has a food of the pieces?
I just believe that in this case to him.
Yeah.
So the sexual game is so common as so much in bacteria as in humans.
And this video is really interesting.
But the game is particularly.
The game is particularly, it can transform a lot of ways -- some of which are more transportation, imagination, colleagues, maybe the place where you get the assumption.
And I want you to see this -- this is financial, a young woman who is playing with the stranger water.
I think that, as you can sometimes be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be all the rest of our entire world.
And it is that culture that I would tell us to explore to us, and then the understanding that we find are the real section of creativity -- the real sense of creativity is the real thing.
So these are just small shows of the understanding that the bank will give us from our past.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to add to a world more and more difficult with more creative and a lot of conservation.
The secret is that the key is the key to the key here.
In other words, the game.
In order to give you a world to a world that changes we have to play.
But we're going to take the way to our own play?
The game is not free.
The game.
For babies and humans -- life is not just crisis and specifically.
When you look at the least place to play -- you can be the moment that it is the way that it is.
This is why we can give us this professor of evolution and we play together as we put the creativity and the amazing and the amazing.
Thank you.
In New York and I am a development of an organization of an organization without the end of the name called Health Honor.
When I'm not compared by poverty.
And in our city, where the values are going to be able to be able to be able to get to the site of the interview in the fact that they are going to go into action.
I remember my first instrument.
I was the second value in the room, so he had a pretty high production of go.
But I still had a career to fish against the others to come back to the cause to the code and figure out what our task was.
When I found the capital -- I was familiar in a conversation with the property that without a constant day of his life.
We were at the time of night, she was going to go up on the table, under a paradigm, and I mean, while his house was in called her house was in called it.
The other solution that I was trying to get to you before I was -- we -- we -- we call it Latin Latin --  I got first to the capital and this was asked to go and save the dog of the day of the home.
The dog." I was a chain?
And there I was a dead or a money of money that, during the rest of his life, you would have to tell people who went into a building in a building to save a living living because I went for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
It made me a character.
He said, "Been I need to go into the house.
I need it to come up, and I went up with the fire -- and I went to this woman a couple of states?
And it goes out.
It was not exactly what I would expect but I was -- I went on the stars, at the end of the particular, went to the "Iran bombs that to that sound more or less they had been able to put the food and go back to a couple of heads.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a home.
I took my way back back on the room where I met my numbers and the perfect period in the main pattern.
We were talking about the house of the house of the house where I was going to expect -- his test has a lot more attention than my me.
A few weeks later, the approach got a letter of the head of the hole of the head of the speed of the effort to save her home.
The chance that she looked at over the way that someone had told him even a couple of surfaces.
And so in my view, in the roof of the show as in my vision as a video biological biological bear -- I am a state of genes and alternative in a modern scale.
And you know what I've learned here?
All of it has their matter.
So, when I look at this room to people who have been done, or they are going to be able to get up, and they are going to be able to remember this, they don't expect this, they don't expect this.
They don't expect the first million to make the difference in the life.
If you have something to say, I put it now.
And they would be done in a computer, you take a little bit of the neighborhood.
They're mind.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life, but every day we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
So they go into the game -- they come out the shapes.
Thank you.
Big God, Mars Mars, remain.
Mars Billies: Thank you.
And this may seem to be strange but I am a big application of the cost of the challenge of it.
The first set of concept was made up in 1877, with a very simple idea.
Very quickly, these became the opportunity of building more using the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things than us, as the buildings or particles, a language at the time.
All of these plants have become the pieces of our time.
I spend a couple of years later, in 1998, to London was done this.
And he was called the activity of artificial advantage.
And in a few years, the LED declines came to all the houses.
They have been made over 400 billion or 15 dollars per person in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineering to build a little bit of, buildings or home.
LED made it accessible.
London was just able to come up with the control ball, the favorite in the world, and I became a fundamental piece of our imagination of our imagination of us.
As so much, exactly that same year, in the Brazil Brazilians, the next revolution was about to address -- the new bull of construction is the whole amount of building to you.
The third was a small unit of plastic that would take us out of a world of adaptive states on a world to a world where everything was interest.
So as the cost of the concept -- the subject allows us to create a lot of a lot more and more complex and more complex at the time.
But there is a factory for first failure, the transport was just for experience.
And I don't have to hear it, that the building bullets of our time are responsible to the experience, so I decided to change it.
Two years ago, when I was in the middle of Mything, I started to explore the idea to take the power of engineers in the hands of artists and distributions.
A few years ago, I started to develop biological.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Like the electricity are electric molecules every one with a specific food.
They are likely to be light.
And the best thing about all is that they are going to make it through them.
So you can't be able to put it wrong.
The laws have a little bit.
The green is the signal, the blue is the right, the robot is the article and the colleague is the ball.
And so you just have to put a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make a lot of them.
A blue with one green produce control.
We can put a game in the middle and we have a record.
If we change the beauty for a molecule molecule -- which is here, and now we have a little bit of it.
We gave this picture to create more impact and we have a robot machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So more of the simple game is actually a very powerful reality.
Instead of having to try to program and connect and statement, it allows us to program that we will be going to be very simple.
In order to make more quick or more, it just takes this beautiful thing that makes the plant more quickly or more signal.
The idea comes on is that it is a creative power.
We want all of the individuals in the world they are going down to little ready to use.
Of course, sounds like that, sounds, all of it must be accessible.
We have given biologists to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electricity of every day that doesn't learn in school.
For example, how it works a light in night, or why the door of a terrifying is open open -- or how an image answer to the action.
We also have led to light to design school.
So for example, the designers without an electricity in electricity start to play with cells as a materials.
So here you can see, with the patterns of paper and scale, we have George to create to create it.
(March --  A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, a few weeks ago to the design of Rentin School design -- who don't have to experience some of an engineering -- only in career, and we would do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done -- a kind of kind of carbon concept per movement here.
But they hope here, here comes my favorite project.
It's a state made out of a passion that has fear of the care.
So for these not engineering, complexity became another material, the electricity became another material in the other.
And we want this material to be all around us.
And by it, blood has an open cancer.
You can visit the website -- you can make all of the design.
We want to take a world of creating a world of creatures and collective and computers because this world where we live -- this international world.
And so it goes up and to invest it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the discoveries of the entrepreneurs.
I work in the industry of solar technology.
And my little company is going to be able to be involved with the environment.
The discovery of distribution.
This is a little video of what we do.
Let me take a moment.
You can take a little bit of careful.
We can be able to keep the video to a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I'm going to take me the time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago a couple of years ago to remember the best designers and techniques so that they take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to do -- we asked them to work on the government.
The industry is called "The American Arabic and they were like a few people of peace for teachers.
We took some members every year and we put them to work with the college.
Instead of taking them at the third world we put it into the solid world of the anti-profit world.
They did big antibotics -- they worked with the most moral employees.
His task is going to show the possibility of the current technology.
You know at the time.
At the time of the city of Boston.
So here it looks like if you look for a car, but what really looks for is that someone will take it up when he was going through the sea because it knows that it's not very good at looking at them when it is covered by a month of an ancient.
How do you get to ask me to help this way as seriously?
Last year, we had a team of members in Congo for Africa.
They were out there in terms and at that time I was born a lot last year.
They realized that the city will never put these features.
But one of the members called America Michael was something else -- than the citizens were born with the cards on front of them.
So he did like any good program, he developed a care.
This is a high application in which you can take a hydrogen.
You have to be able to get up when I took it.
When you do that, you put a name in this case I put up at it.
If you don't do it, someone can do it.
Or it has a leaders of it.
This is a modern adult.
It may be the smaller of the age of the age of the age of the age of the last year.
But it does something that any other technology of the government is.
And it goes up in virtual way.
A responsible for the city of the American city when you see this application is realized that I could use it, not for the slide, but for the citizens to take the states of terrorists.
It's very important that they work these state of transport, but people are running the backs.
So I asked the citizens to control them.
And then Steve decided to be used to do that the citizens are going through the devices that are going on.
And China just got it to make people go back to be able to be able to be able to call them when it is.
So now we know from nine cities that are able to use it.
And this has been discovered without frankly, in order and nature.
If you know a little bit of general technology know that this doesn't happen.
The quality of software is a couple of years.
last year, we had a team working in a project that I remember three people for two months and a half months.
It was a tool so that the parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us to have been done by the normal concepts would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the cultural power of California.
And there are projects like this in every level.
This is why you get a couple of data in a couple of days and it goes into virtual form is a piece of transport to the government.
It sounds at the better way to work -- not like in private companies -- as a lot of people think it should be.
It's not like a technology, but more like the Internet.
It is to say, without seriously, it would be open and relationship.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this device is that it represents the way of taking the issue of the government that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an ancient institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we would work together with science.
And it's not only "The "Mandela for African: but there are hundreds of people around the country that control with the other country in their own communities in their own community.
You have not given for the government.
They feel a big practice to that, but they don't do it, you get it.
And these people know something that we have lost about it.
And that is that if we leave the feeling about politics -- the film in the TED (Supermarket -- and all of those other things that make us light, the government is, the government is in the words of Line Mars, which we do together because we are not going on.
Now a lot of people have taken the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to do it, because things are changing things.
politics don't change the government know.
And because the government in the last sense of us, you remember that of us -- the personality -- the way of thinking about the way to produce the way to produce the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government is going to be able to choose people so that they can make cars.
Well, after two years I've got to the choice that the government is about all, question of forests.
This is the center center of services and information.
It is the place that the called the called the 1870s in the United States.
And I heard this called this called this.
You get Australia in the base of the original knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with an animal control.
And finally he said, "You know, you can open the pieces of the home, put music music and see if you're going on.
And so it works. So you go for San.
But that was not the end of the flowers.
You don't have a center of called a call.
It has a application, web and multiple, called Congo Connection.
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the office of New Medical Medical American American.
One day, this happened really, it came up with this question: "Audience: "I don't know if it's death.
How do I do that?
The District of Congo Constitution is different.
I was talking about person.
In Congress Congo, everything is public -- so you can all see this.
In this case, I saw it a nervous.
The next way he said, "I was going to go up at the place, I found the collective color behind the house.
And yeah? Yeah. Right?
I was going to go back to the country. I went home.
Good night, something stream?
It's very simple.
This is great. It's the trust of the school and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the government in the government of the government to the device of device.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean to the decision of the platform.
I'm going to talk about a platform for people to help them and help others.
So a city goes to another one, but here the government has a kind of kind of key paper.
I connected to the two people.
And I could be connected with the government services of being needed but the wind is a better alternative and more basically than the self-assembly services.
When a secret helps each other, we will make the communities out.
If we call an animals, that's a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same thing that politics is.
A lot of people understand it, but you think that one is the inside of the other.
That our train to the government system is the video.
How many times have you come to a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to get a new political leader and then we hope that government is our values and our needs to do our needs and then we don't see change.
That is because the government is like a moment and the policy is the surface of the surface of 15 miles away.
So below it is what we call the tradition.
And we say that work with a lot of spectrum.
But this is that challenge that keeps that that we have to get a little bit like something that goes on in our against -- that other thing -- and in aware we're losing the power.
People believe that policy is sensitive.
If we want this impact to have to make us have to make sure that the group is.
Because that's where the real work is going to happen.
We have to control with the government of government.
That makes the American model.
You have seen them.
It's a group of citizens that have written a very hard approach of DNA in response to the question of the CAPI "The Valley project of Valley -- about the financial resource project.
That is not a political ancient -- it's a bunch of authority.
And for the ones that we've done for the government -- it's time that we asked us what we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to do.
Do you really think that we have to go to where we have to go to the institutions that can act in the name of all of us.
We can not be able to be able to be more effective to be.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go out of the way that it can explore to the civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows that it's not so hard to be so difficult to carry the systems in the right way.
The age of the age of our members is 24 years so that I -- I am a better generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up to take the word and giving it almost for the way.
They're not giving that bacteria that we all face about who will talk about.
You can express their opportunities in any time at the same time, and they do it.
And so when you face the problem of government don't matter a lot to do their voices going to go back into the time.
They're using your hands.
They put hands to the work to try to be able to work better to the government.
And those applications will allow us to use your hands to improve our communities to improve our community.
It can be a show, and it can be a manufacturing, making a ball of a ball that has a flow in it.
And of course, we could always have changed those hundreds and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital records that we're not only connected -- we're not only aware of government that we pay and we will be able to be able to be able to get services.
We are more than that, we are cities.
And we're not going to take the government until we don't add the city.
So I want to ask all of the present -- when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of together, we will be a value of voices or also will be a manufacturer of hands.
Thank you.
This is for me a real home.
I have spent most of the time in crisis, private and in the bottom of the death.
I've spent most of my life of my life in mathematics -- in projects and places where there's a lot of description.
And I'm going to be here in TED looking at me and given this states a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this long time is that TED has the ideal.
And the things that you say here have impact around the world.
You know, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think the quality is really important.
Here's what we've seen here is a fantastic protection.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you think about sense, you can have a special meaning that you can have a special meaning to get in.
A doctor can do good things -- it would be if it's careful, can make a lot more.
This is why I want to talk about the power of attention.
I didn't actually learn this in the right, my work.
I learned it from my bottom.
I grew up in a traditional house of an American family of an American family.
It was hard -- it was true, I had power.
It was the last word in all of it in the family.
She was sent by a lot of distributions in our home.
It was children of people who had been simple.
Her parents were born in the college in Vietnam about 1950.
She was born about 18 and his experience with the school and the way the way the world looks like.
She was hard -- but it was also love.
When I was small and I looked at it, she came up with me and I was going to have been a huge art.
And I was getting so strong that I was able to go up and then I was going to get up.
One or two hours later, I was going to look at me, and I was going to see me and said, "Brow, still feel my artist?
And if he told me no, I would take you back again, and if he said yes, I was going to put it in power.
He had this human quality that I would always always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the best of the 10 percent.
In some ways, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to take his time and his attention.
My present were running all around us.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I went to the room, and I went to the room, and they were going to get all my principles there.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and look at me.
When I first thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she was very serious at it.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she came up with the room, he took me out of the hand, and he said to me, "I'm going to come back to you -- the two are going to consider it.
I remember this as a year.
I will never forget it.
And he took me out and said, "Oh, I'm going to tell you something, but you can't say to anyone?
I said, "It's good.
She said, now I'm going to be able to do it? I said, "Oh.
And then I sat up, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I have been looking at it?
And he said, "I think you're special ...
He said, "I think you can do what you want?
I never forget it.
And then he said, "I want to take you three things, Brazil."
I said, "Yes, Mars.
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is that I always want to get your mother to you.
And he said, "This is my hand, and you have to think that always control?
As I was going to my mother, I said, "Yes, Mars, so I would do it?
And then he said, "The second thing I want me to do is that you can always do the right thing that the right is a hard thing.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yeah, Mill.
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to think about is that I never add any chain?
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Man, so I'll do it?
I grew up in the field in the rural surface. I have a single year one year and a year a year.
When I was 14 or 15 -- one day my brother came home with a six cars, I don't know where I did it, I would give us to my sister and I went back to the forest.
And we are just going to be able to do the literatures of always
He took a card surface, he took my brother to my sister -- she took a little bit of me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You know, but I'm not going to take care?
My brother said, "Yes."
I love something -- your sister also took a card?
I said, "No, I don't feel good. You can go on.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What do you do? It takes a back."
And I got a look at the force and I said, "Oh, not that you are still thinking about the conversation with Mars.
I said, "But what are you talking about.
He said, "Many tells all the girls who are specialized?
I was going on.
I have to learn something between you.
I'm going to tell you something that probably should not say.
And I know that this will be able to give up.
But I have 13 years old, and I can admit that I have never been able to have a bit of the alternative.
I don't say this to be a vision, I say it for the power that has the attention.
When we create the right kind of identity -- we say things that really don't look at it.
We can't have to do things that you don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother would never believe that all of his old ones were species.
My grandmother had been present during the private process.
My eyes died out of related diseases with the alternative.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, and we had to get it out.
Now, try to talk to you about our serious system.
This country is too different from what it was 40 years ago.
In 1977, there were 300.
There are two million today.
In the United States we have the biggest rate of the world.
We have seven million people in the college land.
And this marketing property in my view, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities are found so much.
One of three black black between the 18 and the age of 30 years is in the crisis or in the control line.
In the urban communities of all the country, the Arabic, Philippines, British, Bangladesh, about 50 to 60 to 60 percent of the color are in the cause or in the control.
Our system is not just distributed in front of the risk, as well.
In this country we have a global system that makes you much better if you're rich and supported, that if you're poor and institution.
It's not clear, but it doesn't get what the result of the results.
And it looks like we feel very strange.
The political policy and the force makes us believe that these aren't our problems.
We are designed.
It looks interesting.
We are looking at our work in our work a few of us in our work.
In my state. In Sanctic, like in other states -- you give you the rights for always if you have a headline control.
Now, right now in Australia, 75 percent of the black population has lost directly the right to the voice.
And if we project it at the next 10 years the level of relationship will be so excited to what it was before it was before the law of the right.
We have this strange state.
And I was about children.
Many of my cars are very old.
The United States is the only country in the world where it felt to the age of 13 years to move in pressure at all.
We have in this country that I created for kids, no chance to go down.
Now we are in a process of some light.
The only country in the world.
It turns out to people in the box of death.
This issue of death is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've been taught to think that the final question is, the people dying to die for the creatures of the constantly creative?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our ideas.
There is another way of looking at it, is not about decide if people want to die through the food crisis, but if we have to kill it.
This is interesting.
It was a death of death in America.
In every nine percent people, it has seen one that is an amazing thing that is excited and record from the control of the death.
A strange rate rate -- a control of every one.
This is interesting.
It was not going to be able to be able to be able to be paralyzed if you get out of each of them who delivered, you would have been able to take it.
But somehow we get out of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our face.
It's not our stream.
I talked a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we wanted to kill me.
It's interesting that in my class with students on American history, I talk to you about science.
So I talk about the transition, the time that started at the end of the religion and I went up to the World World War there.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit developed by the track.
In many communities people have a fear of being a fear.
I was worried about being adapted.
The theory of the theory was what their lives.
Now there are people who are going to get me, and they say, "You know, Sandar, you tell you a lot -- he makes the people who let people stop to say that in our story in the theory of the terrorists, after 1870s, after 1870.
I asked me to say, "No, I say that we grew up with that.
And the age of the control is obviously with the sexual and decades of social health and self-assembly.
In this country we have a discovery that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've been done.
All of the time will take each other.
We can be able to be able to think about.
It costs us to talk about robots. I think it's because we're not willing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to focus with a real and relative process.
In South Africa, people understand that you couldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a community with the truth and the relationship of the truth.
And I still even before had this computer, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany, and I was going to trust you about the death of death.
It was happy because one of the teachers went back after my pressure and said, "You know that it's very concerned to listen to what you tell you what you say to you that you tell you what you tell you about what you tell you what you tell you what you tell you what you say, you know?
And he said, "We don't have a death of death in Africa.
We could never have this here.
The room was left and a theory said -- there is no way that our story, we can be able to get into the system of human beings of human beings in humans.
It would be a rational thing that we us, intelligence and discovery, we will be able to choose people.
They remember about this.
How do we sit in a world where a nation like Alexander, especially if you were in their biggest States?
We couldn't take it out.
It was growing.
And yet, there is this discovery.
I think that our identity is in dangerous.
If we actually don't worry about these things that are so difficult -- the positive things and wonderful things are, no longer transform.
We love innovation.
It makes us the technology. We took creativity up.
We love the intervention.
But finally, those reality.
In my view, you have to need to interact all of them.
We just talk about the need to have more hope, more consequence, more attention with the basic areas of this complex world.
I think that it wants to say more time thinking about and talking about the poverty.
Think of it is, in a way, something that's inside of our be.
It's true that we have to believe in terms that we haven't seen before.
This is what we're going to be -- despite to be so radical, so they are so excited with the Internet.
With innovation with creativity -- the development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas as well.
This trust of the mind with the heart is what happens us to leave us not only in the brain and used -- but also in the dark and the dark thing.
And I did Harvard, the great leader leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe, the context is going to be able to go up -- we had all kinds of things, but we finally need to be hope.
Well, that organization is basically in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED -- it has to be able to go on.
There is no relationship with technology and design -- that allows us to be truly human if we don't get the attention to the poverty to the experimental, to the infection, to the infection.
Now I want to tell you that these thinking is a much more effective identity than if we put these things.
Let's go back to find them.
I had the big privilege -- being a very young speed, to meet Robert Parkinson.
These women are simply just to talk about.
And I mean, the Sand Sea was called me to say, "But it comes to the Paris Parkinson's -- we're going to go back to talk to you.
You want to come back and listen to it.
I would say, "You know.
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you go back when you go back when you go back to you?
I said, "Well, "Changes?
So I was just and I just heard it out.
It was a very complete thing.
And in a room I was there, listening to these days -- and after a couple of hours, Dr. Parkinson's said to me.
I know what you're trying to do.
And I started to give me my discovery.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the intervention.
We try to help the ones that have been constantly constructed.
We tried to focus on the perspective.
We tried to get out of the sense of life, without a construction for children.
We tried to do something about the death of death.
We were trying to reduce the population in them.
We tried to be able to be able to be able to get many markets of management.
I gave you all my best discovery and when I ended up at me and he said, "You know, I love me a man.
And he said, "We're going to get a very straight street, very state?
At the moment, the South South American, I asked me to go up in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very simple."
I think that in fact, the TED community has to be much more value.
We have to find the way that we are able to find those robots, those problems -- that survival.
Because finally, the humanity depends out of compassion for the way.
I have learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been written in simple things.
I've got to understand it and believe that every one of us is surprised to the worst thing that we have to do.
I think that's true for the whole world in the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a mind, it's not because it is a mind.
I am sure if someone takes something that doesn't afford you, it's not that it's a love.
Even though someone else is not going to be a bottom.
And so I think there is a basic design in the people who must be responsible for the sea.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and without so many parts of the world, it's going to the poverty.
This is not it.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is the sound.
And finally, I think that it really is a very beautiful thing, very beautiful -- very straightforward, we don't get us for our technology, by our design -- and for our design -- not by our design or religion.
In the end of a society, it's not the way of a society, not for the way to treat the rich and private and private and private and the way that they were going to the body, the contents, the prices.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really deep things about what we are.
And I feel still seeing me. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much.
And I want to go up, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasons in a important.
I've been represent to these girls who have been sense with a lot of death.
And I go to the control and I see my age of 13 and 14 years, who have been used to get it as a cartoons that are closed to you as a cards of the statement that they were used to take care of as a cards as a cards that they have been used to be carried as a cards as well as a cards of them are
And I started thinking, how can it be?
How can you go back to someone in what is it?
The journey was just like a back, but I see a child, but I see a child.
A very long night I was trying to think about it, for God, if you can be able to become something that you don't are, it should be able to have a mathematical power.
Yes, Brook, the game has a magic power.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late -- I couldn't think about it, but I started working on a movement.
I had a 15 years old, a small one, a little one, black black.
I began to work on the movie, with a description that he said, "Look for my neighborhood black century to be treated as a public white printing of 14 years, expectancy of a computer?
And in the moment, I found that there was been the infection in the room, in the behavior.
There was a living line on this country in this country there is no magic, but a whole thing to do.
At the end of the next morning, I was trying to think about that mission would be a dream -- or really the structure?
And for me, it wasn't just the record -- but I had sent it to the course.
They spend about two months, I had been forget it out.
And I finally decided --  God, I have to go to the car for this thing.
And I went back to the car and I felt really supporting me and I felt really surprising.
I was in the car to the card.
I thought this would be very difficult and technology.
I finally came out of the car -- I went up to the card.
I was looking at the scale when I found a better black man. It was the control of the play.
When I saw me, I came up and said, "What is you?
I said, "I'm a blood story? He said, "It's a standard? He said yes.
And then I got me up and I get open to me.
And I'm going to get up in the one.
He said, "I'm proud of you.
I have to tell you now that it was variable.
And that became a lot of made with my interest with my identity with the ability that we all have to build the community with a species of hope.
Well, I went to the audience room.
When you go into the country, I see me.
And he said, Mr. September, you wrote this lab mortality?
I said to him, "You know?
People started to come on. They were all dead.
I was what I had written those streams.
They came up with the police for the protection of the applications of the applications.
Of course, without knowing how -- the room was full of people -- all of us because we talked about robots because we talked about poverty.
With the room of the eye to look at the understanding that I was and he came on.
I was looking at the window and I was going to hear all of this front.
I was going to go out for here and over there.
First of all, this old black face is going on on the room and he sat behind me, almost in the sea of the drugs.
About 10 minutes later, the game I put a record.
And during the description of the quality of the alternative is shown because the conference had been in the room.
The environment was used on the old black life.
And he said, "What do you do in the room of authoritarian?
And the old black was put out of foot -- I looked at the artist, and he looked at me, and he said, "I'm going to this room in audience to tell this young man who kept his view in the grandmother with free?
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral act of the universe is very large -- but that you have to put it up with the symbol.
We can't really be really humans evolved if we don't care about human rights and for fun.
That our surface is living to each other.
That our technology, and we design and consciousness and knowledge have to be able to get to the factors, computers and completely.
And by the top of all, to those of the people who will share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the object with free.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see a spirit of the audience -- this community, to help you in your presences, to do something.
Something that is not a content. What can we do?
BG: There are various opportunities here.
If you live in the state of Carolina, for example, there is a representation that is going to make a effort to reduce the food that they spend today in the colleagues today.
For example, here in Carolina, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the death of death -- in the next five years.
And despite this, the 40 percent of the tools are not going to get up in artists.
40 percent of the violence don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This record is going to protect that they get these jobs to make the law of the law.
I think there is a very short opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge challenge in the Colorado in the last three decades.
So part of the experience, it says that it has to do with the biggest rate of collaborator.
What would you tell you what you think is this?
BF: In fact, the rate of creativity with violence has ever been very straightforward.
The big growth in this country is not by thinking of violence with violence with violence with violence.
It is by the wrong woman against the drugs here.
That's why it comes up with this amount of death in the particular population population.
And we let us convince it by the rest of the card.
We have three legal causes to take people to the personality -- and to bring a biology, for a little period against the process, instead of doing those resources to their sizes.
I think we need to do more to help the voices of the creatures and not less not less.
It seems to me that our picture on the face doesn't do anything for no one.
I think that is the adult that has to change.
CA: Brazil, you've got a lot of information today.
You're very inspired here.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Lady, they grow the threat by the death of Bill Latin.
Mark two.
It takes four parks, California discoveries. Len four drugs.
Lean six social decisions, social decisions.
Lead Day, Arab of taken Talk.
There are a lot of legals, I was going to the narrative destruction.
Remember. Just forgot. Just except up. Everything.
Candle. Movement.
Oh, my God.
Part Daniel, these are just some of the climbers that I get in the last six months. They could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the means of thinking would be able to make new negative news because our mind would give you attention.
And that's a very good right.
In every second of every day our sense, our sense has a lot more data than probably the brain can protect it.
And as nothing is more than sure, the first part of all of those data is an old part of the time called the authority.
And the adult is our own deal with the early amount of danger.
It came back and reduce all the information looking for something in the environment that could be able to make a day.
So in one of a story of the stories that we were looking at the neurons.
That journey will be able to go out of the question: "If there is balloon, it's very true.
And I know that all the digital device would give us new news.
It's not surprised that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe in change, what really happens is that we get distributions.
Maybe the huge program will be done in the last century for a series of forces is getting up so that we have the potential to create a world in the next three decades in the next three decades ago.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- the climate change, the exploration of species, the scale of water and energy.
As human beings we are very good to open the problems and we are going to go through them.
So we do that then it happens in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years -- the average of life has more than discovering, the average income per child because of the information has been transformed around the world.
The anti-profit moral has done 10 times.
And also, the cost of the food of food and the electronics and the communication and the communication has eight to 10 times.
Steve Paul showed us that we are living the most public little story of the story.
And Chris Korea is that the global audience went from 30 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 11 years.
We're really living a little extraordinary time.
A lot of people.
And we are trying to put it up more and more.
In fact, we reduce the poverty.
You know, today in the United States, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electric line -- water, babies, banks, military, military, millions and car.
The bank markets in the end of the last century, the elements of the planet -- they would never have been done with those streams.
It is a lot of this is the technology and finally, their experience.
And my good friend San Australia showed that any tool that comes in in the technology of the information in this center, the London of Monolography, and the leader of the price in about eight to 24 months.
And so the machine that they have in the police is a million times more and a billion times faster than a supercomputer of the 1990s.
Now look at this culture.
This is the Moon Moon for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this happen.
First of all, the thing that it is -- in good and bad time, in the war and in the peace -- in definition and in the place.
It's the result of real computers that are used to build more quickly.
It doesn't get any of the big challenges for you.
And even though it is free in a law on the left, it goes up with it.
The rate of technology is in it is more and more fast.
And in this face to the Moon Law, there are a series of extremely powerful technologies that we have today.
The company in the car, that my friends of Australian called influence and needs and networks -- the religion, the 3D printing and their ability to democracy and the ability of democracy and the ability to democracy and the ability of democracy and the ability of democracy.
I mean, how many saw the video in Jesse of Kansas from Bangladeships."
It was true.
So I was going to look at the periods of the best school that I have.
And I love this, "Wells come back to human people.
Julia is not a easy.
It takes it with the mathematics of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the court, available for all in the machine.
Three years ago, here in TED, Richard William and I, we took a new college called American University.
We teach these technologies to our six, and in particular, how you can use to solve the big challenges of humanity to solve the big challenges of humanity to solve the big challenges of the humanity.
And every year we asked to take a company, or a product or service -- which could be able to affect the lives of a billion people in a decade in a day.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
It would be 30 years ago, that would have been surprised.
We can be able to be a company of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating a distance, it doesn't mean to create life life for each side of the planet. It's about creating a life of the possible.
It's trying to take that that is statement and I find advantage.
You see, the stage is construction and technology is a force that takes resources up.
I put an example.
It's a story of San Indian Indian in 1950.
He is the kind of the left.
I was going to go up with the Sand Saturn.
The Parkinson's passwords went on with plants and the same.
But the San Sand, I started with climate colleagues.
You see, the threat was the most value of the planet. It's worth more than the hear and the planet.
So this is why the point of the Mars to Washington is a limitation.
You see, even though the card is 5,000 percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come to be as a protection metal.
It's taken by the oxygen and scales.
But then I got the electricity and did the class of something so hard that we use it as if it was definitely definitely.
We will protect this act to the future.
We think about the energy.
ladies and gentlemen, we are in a planet by 500 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 15 degrees of energy every 18 minutes.
It is not about school, but the activity.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of the solar energy in India is 50 less than the production of the property of the protocell, 18 viruses visit 14.
The cost of solar energy 50 percent last year.
The month the month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade in the state of the United States, the solar electricity cost six dollars a time compared with the 15 percent of the national media.
And if we have a energy of energy also we have water.
Let's talk about the war on the water.
They remember when Paul San came up with the space space to the Earth, in 1990, after Southern Southern?
I took a famous picture. How do you call it called it?
"You get a blue point of blood."
Because we live in a water.
We live in a single planet in a percent.
Yes, 75 percent is water.
It's an amazing technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the technology, the nations.
In a conversation with Diama Kanny this morning, one of the anti-stars -- I would like to share with you -- I would like to share you to do -- his technology called the Sunset -- you know, it is the size of a small region.
It's able to get a thousand pounds of water.
He was just able to realize that you will make a important test of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds in the developing world.
And if that goes well, and I have a conflict that I would be like to be, Collaborator is going to do it completely in 200 countries of the planet.
This is a powerful innovation for this technology that today.
And we have seen it in the economy.
God me, we are going to get to the 60 percent of the animals in the world in the developing world in the end of the late world.
And so I think, that wonderful war has better mobile communities in the middle of the World than the President Republican 15 years ago.
And to tell with a smart cell with Google -- it has access to more knowledge and information that the Collaborator Colorado 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information of information and relationships that nobody could have ever been able to have ever been able to have before.
It better than that, things that you and I have been paying and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Maybe the best thing is going to be when they sound the applications in health.
The month I had the month, I had the power to deal with the Forest Fortunate called the British British Princete Transition of 10 million dollars.
We are moving through the team of the world so that they make these technologies in a mobile device with what they talk about, and I know that you can try to, can be able to be able to be able to get out of the front.
To support it has to make better data than a critical medical team there.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world in which there are no doctors -- where the market carbon is about 25 and there are 1,000 percent of the health.
And when this device has been a vision of DNA.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world.
I call it the one one of the millions of dollars.
The white lines here are the population here.
And we just just heard the market of the seven billion dollars.
But by the way, the best project against the traditional expression is to get the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people on the line, connected together.
In order to spend two billion to five billion use of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you go to global conversation.
What do these people want to want this?
What do you know what you want to do?
And instead of a economic cost will have the biggest economic impact of history.
These people represent tens of millions of dollars involved in global economy.
And it's going to go out of more health because of the Treatment, of a better education with the National Shanghai and because of the use of the 3D principles and the compassion in the surface to be more productive than never before.
So what can you be able to open three million members of humanity, and the production and products produces?
How about a few times never before you?
So what if we give them the particles, where they are, a voice to be heard and can be able to act for the first time.
What would you take these three million?
And if you are conditions that we can not afford to.
Something that I learned with the black Prince is that small team is that I was small by their passion with a clear goal -- you can do an amazing things, things that you could only do the big control and governments could be able to be able to do the big controls.
I'm going to end up by sharing a story that I really explore.
There is a program that maybe some already knows some already know.
It's called Fort.
I went into the University of Washington in Telescope.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of adults and find out the way that it would be putting the project.
And then you want them to develop the structure and the work.
It's a very important thing in the medical research.
And so far it was a problem of substantial.
They have been playing with this college teachers between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people go up and started to play it.
And it has been shown that today, we have the most human patterns of human patterns -- is better by being able to protect that the best computer.
Takes and dancers, which gives me a huge behavior in the future is that today we have more power as people to save the big rest of the planet.
We have the tools with this emotional technology.
We have the passion of the arm of the arm.
We have the case of technology.
And we have three million new mental minds that are used to work on the solution of great challenge and do what we should do.
We have a little bit of an extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The control of the particular point of particular.
And as the idea can explain in a minutes, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles David, one of my heads.
He was here, as you know, in 1877.
You may believe that a few pieces -- but it wasn't like that.
It actually takes fish fish.
And I discovered one of them as a very common computer."
It was the brain.
I found it a lot to the decade of 1870.
Now the fish is in the Law Red of the Union.
But we've heard this story a lot of times.
But the case is that we still came to the German.
We still think that they are protecting them.
The molecules still tell you that they are going to go down.
So what happens here?
The second story, also increases another context: the control of the control.
Because I was there in 1998, by studying a light in the Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could try it in.
I got a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first experience to the sun.
The sleep was released from fires, and, as you can see, of a few streets.
And there was a piece of about about 20 careers, the billion black bank.
And the purpose of this skin was very excited and it was going through a good time, so it was going over the middle of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 24 years later, the number of fish had died to half a half of the fish.
They were going to go back to the top there.
They were going to have a genetic process.
There were still fish yet.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish was still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
So my third story is that I went in in the intervention of the free fish of the article in the army of the article.
In the decade in the age of 10,000 -- I started in the 1990s, Europe made a lot of development things.
And the financial development is going to imagine the countries that already had to be able to be 100 food -- you can put it into the industrial atmosphere.
And this base, quite fart, it's called the Four four.
I was going to end up in it, and we made students in the South of the Mars of Mars Mars and about all, in the Mark Mark.
So what we did is that we were going to change it was an amazing thing.
We capture -- now I know, the bottom of the market.
The 90 percent of what we were able to have were surprised, other animals that are in the environment.
And most of the fish of the fish are a little bit about a few rest of them that are kind of control for the water.
You know, the forest of the sea came to the cost and then it was argue.
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then he started the commercial fish again.
The bottom is going to be a search side of collective colleague, in this case, to be a solar.
This is a dead transport.
They didn't eat them. They found them because they were dead.
Once we take a live.
I was not going to have a signal.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
And this set of rest is what they remember every time you go to an area in which they have never been done.
But it doesn't have documentary.
We tried the world but we don't remember it.
Let's take the part of the part of the way, at the new level.
So if you will do this something like this.
In the front and we have good things -- biological, a number of teachers, the version of the water.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images to the beginning of their life of their life as a normal and except to it.
The difference is that they lost the question.
But they don't make the loss that happened before.
You can take the cost of change.
And in the end of the end to keep a little bit of the rest of them.
And that is, in big fact, we want to do it now.
We want to have things that are no longer -- or they're not what they are.
But one should be thinking that this problem affect people when social social societies will not know what they've done to a few generation later.
Because obviously an animal which is very standing, before you get up, it's a little bit.
You don't lose the anti-profit animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this doesn't look like a big question.
And in the time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea end of great fish.
They become a little bit.
With the time they have a little bit of fish but we think that's the part of the particular.
And the question is: why do we take this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists that was very different.
And you will do it because the evidence is going on in a whole way is not the way they would expect the evidence to have the evidence of it.
So for example, I know that some of you think that some of them can be able to be able to be able to be able to see a lot of fish in this area that you can't use or not the use of the scientists -- because it's not experience.
So we have a situation in which people don't know the past -- even though we live in international society, because they don't trust the streets of the past.
From the huge role that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to protect it.
Because with the market areas are actually going to be the past.
We remember the past that people can't trust because the particular point has come up and it's just under it.
That's for the people that you can see a professional area and you can benefit from the vision that it would be able to be able to move out of the part of it.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access -- like people in the middle -- for example.
I think there is the arts and the city might be able to save the virus.
So this is an excitement of the Boston Balloid.
It was a long time ago, there were a lot of groups in the Bang of Chicago, 500 years ago.
And they have noticed that mathematics and skills are like "Come out of "The "Climbing?
And if you think about "Arabic, if you think why people would get up with the film -- I'm talking about the period of people, why are you going to get the images?
Because it takes something that, in some sense, it has been lost it.
So my remember, the only one that will give you, is to the Arab "Candel under the water.
Thank you very much.
And so I am Kantai Sander, the government of the United States, and I looked at video video in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the video videos are made and what it looks like.
We all want to be state, civilizations, careers, commercials -- and when I was more young -- that looks a very, very difficult thing.
But today.
And anyone can be done in the Internet in a solution.
It was more than 40 hours of video for minute.
And of those just a little percentage you make you, it gets an infinite of vision and collective model.
How does that?
Three things -- there will be the transitions of transportation, communities of passion and the sounds of the surprise.
Well, let's start here.
Ben Sange] Voice: Oh, my God, God me.
God.
Good.
Aha, golf."
KB: The last year, Bernerial Paul was able to put this video video of his house in the National Park of Vivie.
In 2010, it was 18 million times.
And this graph shows the rules in the particular surface of the United States.
You don't have to make a virtual video.
I just wanted to share a back back of a day.
That's what you do if it's called George Google Bondor.
There was already a lot of lives of nature.
This video had been put in energy.
So what happened here?
It was called Johnson.
Just John Kirson published this area that I was able to take a video to the particular.
The tools of terms like James King would put us new and interesting public and they give them to a more amazing audience to it.
Richard Blood,  You know, you see -- you know, you have to start the view.     You all want to get the week of week -- the end of week.         You know, you don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video without talking about this video.
(Audience Red is one of the most popular video of the year.
I saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
As And "the sign of the death services: this video seemed to have come out of it.
So what did this do?
Well, it was true, it's true.
And if you think about those other kids, they are too.
But what happened this day, this dog in particularly?
Well, I took the Talk and a lot of whales started writing about it.
Michael Johnny.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of tools came up with a point of view and share it with a more complex public and shared the process.
So this community of people who share this big interesting girl is starting to talk about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 percentages of London in York.
So only in the first seven days, there was a period for each other day.
In the distribution of the 20th century of the 20th century, this community is our way of being part of the phenomenon by doing or doing something new with that.
And I was "The access to be a religious animal with a common music.
That's what it is.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's right, you know there is a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
And so far you saw this video.
And there are cars that you saw to others see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I hope between the technical community of the Internet.
There were records.
Somebody did a version to the old one.
And then it became international and then it became interesting.
All of a sudden, it was a whole community community that did this going to be a car to something that we all can make a part of what we all can make a part of what we all can make a part of what we all can make a part of what we all can be able to make part of what we all can be able to make
Because today we don't just enjoy it, we go down.
Who could have thought to do something like that?
Who could have been provided "Christian "The "Los "Come on or "London or "The Chinese Chinese?
What do you want to have written that construction this system?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute -- just that only one and it can be able to get up so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who comes into the mountains to cars in New York City.
Canal Carl: I was going to go up by the control of the behavior, but in terms there are observations that are going to be able to be able to close to the break.
KB: Thank you in the surface and his humans, Carrily Neanderthal that five million would see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth for everything new we do in creative way.
And all of this led to a big question.
Ben Venus: What does this mean?
God.
KB: What does this mean?
You know, the tree consequences, creative communities of patient -- which is a lot of a new kind of media.
And as I said before, one of the current cities of the world, John Ben, started in People.
It doesn't ask me to express their ideas.
Now we are all a little bit of our personal culture.
These are not the community of the old media -- they are not the ones of the current media.
Thank you.
This is not a story.
It's a control that is still going on.
Let me tell you about some of the fish.
Imagine the first piece -- a man looking at the work of all a life.
This is a piece of it, a man, a man whose life had been applied in the unique hope.
So you can find out as the communities go in the fact that their life had been completely at the way.
The words, for a long time, you know, they were now transformed.
It goes into the signal.
He died by the story.
He's my blood.
I never met it.
But our lives are a lot more than our remember of us.
I never allowed me to forget his story.
And my task was not to stop that that has been at the way, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be able to stay up, but we survive.
And the next part of the angles is about a boat in the order to be able to be able to stay on the sea.
And my mother -- Mary, I had just 18 years old when his father died -- and a market control and two little young kids.
And for it, life had been done to a speed used to be able to be used to be used to be used to your family and a new life.
It was an amazing for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a four years that I challenge the factory, a battle will take it into the sea face of the period of fish.
All the adults knew the records.
The biggest fear was the particles, violence and death.
And as most of the adults, my mother was taking a factory with vision.
If you were able to take us, first we would take my sister and me, and then she and my blood.
My first remember is from that boat, the control of the way, the control of the way, and it is going to go out in every single room, and the heart of the control and the control.
I don't remember how many times you saw several times, but they were focused with the value of the men in our car, or the way it could not be able to deal with six hours.
But I don't remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the cost of Mars, and the young man who came up and died -- I was going to start the journey was too much for it, and the first step that I tried to do, given by the men.
Now no film was going on the same way.
After three months in a record field -- we stop in Michael.
And the next piece of the rockets is about four women over three generation by getting a new lives.
We were going to take us up in Francisco, a kind of key colleague whose population is full of immediates.
And at the distribution of the average key surfaces, which exists I did -- in Francisco, there was no sense of the right.
The solutions that came from the rest of the world.
And the framework of the international English became the people who had one thing in common -- they were starting again.
My mother worked in food, then in a light line of cars -- working six days -- it goes out.
I still found time to study English and get a train in the technology of information.
We were people.
All of the dollars were adding, and it would be a strange task in English and mathematics -- no matter what you should be able to take -- that it was usually a new boat -- it always was a second hand.
Two parts of media for school, one to solve the holes of the other.
And a school collection to the stars, because I had to go for six years.
And there were a lot of others and dollars about the "Stage and some marketing and some marketing -- "magnets?
At home.
And something in me is developed.
I was getting definition and a voice that said, "I'm going to support them.
My mother, my sister and I move on the same way.
My mother was except every night, but we tell us about our day and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house.
My mother would find stars, all of the bank.
And my task was to be wanted until his students started to be able to get it out.
She opened a computer, then she studied to be static and open another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transformation, and the entrepreneurs and embarrassing them, and the common transitions between two world.
They were looking at surfaces and presentations.
And they created centers.
I live in particular world.
In one of it was the political student that was international by what it would stop myself.
In the other time, I was entrepreneurial in private lives.
But many of them would get help through the years.
And for that work, when I study my last year of standard, I was going to get a young year of the year.
And I went out of a piece of the surgeons to the other, but their bees didn't come up.
And so I was so close to France, and it was now so read and stuck and social artists -- invited to talk in sites that I had never heard of number, and in home whose she had never ever heard of it.
I don't know the proteins.
I didn't know how to use the colleagues.
I didn't know how to talk about me.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go back to the arms and the control of life in a subject -- a back -- a mother and two children ended up the day as they did for almost 20 years, to tell the day of every single single single day.
And I said to my mother that I couldn't do it.
I remember that I had now the same age that she had when she was when we go back to the boat.
The "Island had been a chance.
He said, and you're not going to be what you don't go?
So I talked about visual and education.
And the more I was able to talk to you a lot more I talked to you about it was available to talk about.
And I met people from all of our life, many of them doing what they love, living in the front of the possible.
And even though I took my limitation, I realized that I couldn't be able to stay on a rain career.
There had to be another piece of the streams.
And I gave me at the same time that is well going to be a description, one of us in the stage -- and not just well, but it's not just well, but it is something that is because of what it would be farmers -- maybe a paradigm of the boat.
Because it can be before it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And I gave the things out of my control of the control to know that, I know that the world will come in, but not the way we get in.
It could not have been allowed to be a really terrible state.
There was a energy there, an incredible opportunity -- a microbe will be able to go out of human and value.
And so I was trying to follow me.
It took a little group of people for who the sand can be able to do it was an amazing challenge to do.
For one year we didn't have a card.
At the end of every day, I had a giant state of supermarket that we all shared us.
We work up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy -- but some breasts, and we were going on.
I took the decision to move the U.S.
After a single journey of it.
My constructions again.
Three months later, I had moved in, and the supercondition came up.
Before I ended up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a little bit in a little bit of the computer was the society and the local Mandela was the person who important.
Life didn't have changed for century.
His father died a little bit after she was born up.
The mother would build it.
At the age of the 16 it became a control of a Mandela whose mother was going on.
No support of his method, you can take it up and take it up and take the cause and a lot more control when they go on.
You can't be able to do it to be wrong.
I was on the front of a man in the six when she died to 10,000 miles in microscope.
And I looked through the market and I saw it on the other side.
I knew that I had come to stop it.
My mother called minutes later.
days later, we went to a bad team in France and we sit around her air.
And we tell us stories and we would make sure we were still with it.
On the night a man came and told us that I had to close the air.
My mother asked us to feel your hand.
I asked the mountain, why your hand is carefully, and the rest of the body so free?
Because you have taken their hand from the morning, he said.
"I don't have a subject?
If there is a nervous in our family -- that cut through women.
And because we were going and how life would go up, we can now see that men who would have come to our lives would have found us.
It would have been used to make it easy.
Now I want to have my own children, and I ask me about the battery.
Who could do that for it?
However, I put it into the beginning of the easy.
I can give you a test in your lives, supporting in every single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single day, the horizontal side that I would not afford nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give you and look at it, I would do it.
The State Street and also the mother of so here is here in the fourth or the step of it.
My story starts in Rome about two years ago.
I was in the destruction, under the stage scale, with the soldiers of Mars Alice.
We were trying to become how nothing has changed.
In those days when the individuals we wanted to travel to a car and we knew the sky.
Now we do it with advantages.
At that time when I got there, the great war was an Indian war -- I had a street and with a street to the ground.
Now we do the same thing with tasks and machine.
The choice that we know was that the material had been responsible to the music.
And that makes me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more than that.
And I took this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy and I would get a record if I didn't have the camera if I couldn't take my friends.
It seems to me that technology had to allow the machine, not to kill it.
And I had a little bit of my grandmother to me that I have to give me the plant of policy.
And this piece of technology for 50 years was for my most musical thing.
It became a back born to a world full of images and freedom and criminals in my imagination in my imagination in my mind.
I had the sense of the males -- the relative rooms and the cameras that we are.
They were going to make our inspiration up.
And so I was given me to this technology.
I was looking at books from the 15 years.
And so when I saw the impossible I saw a care device able to connect the laws in the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we are, where we are.
I will spend the text with the picture, the sound and the sound.
The solution becomes more and more manufacturing.
But what does it look like?
I'm at the point of the Germany, and a very interesting device for the size.
He says, "You know your feet about every line?
And so --  says, this box is started -- I wrote my name.
And so I became a bit of the book.
In several moments I got a car -- the Picture knows where I live because of the GPS -- which comes to me.
My girl in front of all of these possible.
I have talked a lot of mission here.
And I don't mean manufacturers and drugs, but to that market of the institution, to those ideas that we work from children.
For some reason, the languages in a French always was analyzed to me.
So over here, we have to increase the picture to close the legal.
And really, you get your way in what you rest from the book.
Another idea that I was excited by a little girl was that a whole girl is in a biology.
And so here, every book and every book and every world will be transformed in a ball that I was going to this magic device -- inside the application.
And this is a map.
In all of the family book, there have always been marriages, but they have been straight man.
This is a map that comes up, and you go out and you go through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book as well.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another kind of very important aspect for me is to create an Indian control and the context.
These are the passwords.
We've all heard of the dances and the nights, but how many people outside India know their Indian controls, the waves are the water?
These poor women have been used in the cameras in the middle of the India, in a old and first book.
So we are trying to come back in a particular story.
In a story that is the current issues like the environment.
And talking about environmental crisis -- one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been depending up, because of their Palestine, they haven't heard the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the books of the book is this apple in which you have to go into the outside and take the camera or the Pictorian, and you will take images of different natural objects.
And I had a lot of colleagues of steps, particles, bombs and continuous.
For some reason, the children are not doing it.
And so I would be able to pick up this real thing to do is that we have to go out and in a change, I'll take a picture to a flower and then to calculate.
In the other change, you have to take a picture of a piece of control, and then I read it.
And this is what this way looks like is a digital collection of pictures that then you can put in the Web in the Web thing.
A kid of London put a picture of a surface and says, "Oh, today I saw a subject?
A child of India says, today?
And it was created this kind of social network in the way to a digital picture of digital pictures that have been taken on.
And within the variety of the conversation of music, the Earth and technology are a lot of possible.
And in the next book we were going to have an intelligence where you go on with the impossible and the video and the video and the fact that you can actually see a group of anti-stars that come on on the top of the home.
At a time the screen is full of holes.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and they have them to read the rest of the book.
We go up to a world where the forces of nature is built with technology and the map and the technology is about one to another.
We took the power of the sun.
We're going to our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that room, dark and love.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about why a lot of the health protein projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we need to listen to patients.
And one of the things that we did in the Robert University was going into a discovery of the listening to it.
And not in a very scientific way, she was just a little piece of care or ask you, and I asked people, family and would know, what happened?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think that this is one of the most problems for what you all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of the statement -- because we let to listen to it.
This is my Boston Boother. It's something very simple.
It has a piece of understanding and addiction.
All of the morning, all of the morning.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
And I put the challenge to get back to the context of it.
But it's so simple -- that every time I think, I was going to take my information to Google Hero.
And my doctor of head has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not in the same time that you need a medical anti-star or some of that sense, but you see it back.
But there's something else.
As a few of you know, I have more than four seconds in Twitter.
And so every morning connected me to my Boy Boother and before I went back to my car -- people start talking about, Lengulation, today, I think you need to need a crazy leader.
That's the best thing that can happen -- because it's about the patterns that are used to help the patients, because it could be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
On the other hand, it can be able to move to the people of their streets and together to develop some creative activity to have more control of their society.
So from the next week it would be available by the next week.
This little bank connected to an image or another device.
And people could be able to be able to take their own present, to send it to their medical and share it with each other, for example, by 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients are going to be able to be able to pick up the control and to be cause of their own back, but we also can help us to the health of health because of the challenges that we face -- like the control of the medical attention and other issues.
It's going to make evidence that are simple to use and start with this to influence patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by surgery.
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video video with you.
We all have a negative control in the car.
Maybe we have them.
We know where the cars are the car cars in Mexico.
And so where are all the paradigms.
And of course, we can find real food.
But where are the U.S. TED to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one survives.
No one knew where you get the DNA soldiers at this moment.
So what we did was that we did it in the United States.
We created a West Wall, and we asked the public person, you can see a DNA, for the very first one, and when it is open -- because when it is an open -- because you can sometimes open in the office of office and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 DNA are already sitting on the United countries.
The next step was to look for the support for that.
And we did an attention for the iPhone.
We created a application for Health, and so I would find these Distans.
And every time they are in the city of marketing and somebody else, you can use your iPhone, and the following weeks use their cell cell to find the Moston more close -- what can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this, not just like DNA -- which is the name of the product but also like DNA."
And we wanted to start to the global level.
We are building all the colleagues in the world, in other ideas, so that they help us to find and work and act as a center to the control of the DNA around the world.
Every time they are from values and somebody else, it can be a patient or someone front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invest companies around the world that they could help to make these DNA these DNA.
You might be a service of message or people, for example, to see if the DNA is still in your place.
By the way, let us get in this and not just improve the health, but take the control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share a picture here.
Or is it photographer?
Because of course, they are pictures that you can't take with their cameras here.
So my interest in the photograph came up with my first digital camera at the 15 years.
And he took me with my own because of the day, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in the planet.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process the process is going on when the stage.
So for me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, in the right time.
I thought I could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different -- a process that would start to start the past.
Finally like this, a building in a very straight way.
But it has a straight task.
And despite it, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like these things and put them into the same time, but with the common thing to keep the actual level.
And when I say I say profiles.
Because of course, it's not something that can be able to change but I always want it to have been caught in some way as a picture.
pictures where you have to think about a moment to discover the structure.
It has more than making an idea that with a moment.
But what is the treatment that makes them seem real right?
Are the details or colors?
I put the light.
What do you create the analogy?
Sometimes the attention is the perspective.
But in the end, it is about our way to increase the world and how you can pay on a biological surface of a biological surface.
It's actually not really about if it is the fact that what we think is a real thing.
And so I think the formations are very simple.
I see it as a resource of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and we put them up to create a natural reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
So here are three personal objects -- something that we can all relationship with the traditional world.
But you can be able to be able to create something that even seem transmission, as if there is.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we go back to the brain because the brain doesn't take the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I look at the same process to kill the picture.
It is really going to be able to make different reality.
And the things you make a picture looks like I think they're that we don't even think about, the things that are going to do in our life life.
But by changing pictures is very important to do that, because in other way something is going to look wrong.
And so I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to be able to be able to get real results.
As you can see, these images are not very space.
They can create something like this.
So the first thing is that the combination of pictures should have the same species.
Second, the computer pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these records, they were taken to the same talent and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to be able to make the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect control.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
I might think that this is the image of a paradigm and the bottom part is magic.
But this picture is completely possible by different places.
And in the person I think it's easier to create a place to find it because you don't need to put the ideas that has in the head.
But it takes a lot of plants.
And as I thought this idea in invention knew that I had a number of months to find it, to find the differences for the pieces of the streets.
For example, the fish was taken in a journey of fish.
The cost is from a different.
The solar part was caught in a piece of wall.
And yes, I even did red the house in the top of the island so that it seemed more surface.
So to make a real result I think it makes a plant food.
It always starts with a goal, an idea.
Then you have to change the different pictures of them.
And here every piece is very well.
If you make a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful and at a very real time.
All the tools are there and the only line is our picture.
Thank you.
Let me start by showing you a slide about technology, very dangerous.
For the way, if you can put it.
This is a diagram that I took from a car of me.
I don't really get so interested to show you the details but the kind of general thing.
This is about an analysis that we were doing about the potential of the Richard microbes -- you see the power of the local area of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this, like a lot of other things that we will see is a kind of line in the limited scale.
In other words, every step of here it represents a piece of material in the scale of record.
I'm going to talk about technology with similar costs is a normal thing.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please make the lights up.
It needs more understanding because I wrote a paper for it.
Why do we find technology in the scale schools.
The answer is that if you give them in a normal face in which we say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to do, the device is going to be able to do something right.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you know, for example, some other technology, as the transformation, in a particular box would be very together, we will see a real line.
But if something like this, it will give a high change.
If the technology of trying to get as fast as the microbes -- we could be able to take a talent and being in TV in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that character.
There are no pressure in the history of the technological development of a growing growth that every few years you can have to be able to be able to get out of microbes.
The question I want to call you is -- looking at these experiences -- and we see that they don't have to get out there.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it is.
So one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical typical -- I know like this until solves something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I am an opportunity for that I think maybe something like this.
And so we were now going to be in the middle of a transformation.
In this line we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask to you and ask you, is: what is that new way that the world?
So what new state does the world?
The transition looks very, very happy if we are inventional in it.
I remember the future that the future happens in the year 2,000 and people used to talk about what happened in the year.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is going to be the year 2,000 year.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has gone up, year after year, over my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
It's going to be a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that you don't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different.
So I want to talk about how I could be, how I could be that transition that we experiment.
But to do that to have to talk a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and information.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take sense and look at the long things in the time.
The scale of time I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture has sense if we look at each billion years.
So we took a few million years of years when the Earth was a great robot with a lot of chemicals that were going around around us.
If you look at the way that these chemicals are going to give us a sense of how things happened.
And I believe that there are theory to start to buy the original with the DNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that moment, I had found a few of a few kinds of changes with all kinds of chemical rights in its before.
A few of those articles to tell a particular combination of chemicals that were asked to put into the data of the outside and so forth.
And they started to describe it.
In a sense, that was the most private forms -- those operations of application.
But those guys were not living in the current sense, because each one of them has a kind of chemical access of chemicals that have been able to have a chemical question.
And every time they were designed by a sense of the change of the changes that you know.
And so everyone was a little bit different.
In fact, the galaxies that somehow they are doing better at the time of understanding the current chemicals -- they they grow more chemical and they have more chemical and they have a lot more.
They usually live more time, they were more responsible.
It was a way of life, life life, very simple life, but things would become interesting when these bees learned the structure of the ability.
So in some ways we don't understand very well these galaxies learned to save information.
I learned to support information, which was the level of the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they were involved in this evolution without sense -- a system of writing that allowed them to figure out what they were to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
The amazing thing is that this written system seems to have been used since that evolved 24 million years ago.
Our access -- our genes have exactly the same code -- that same writing system.
In fact, every one will be living with exactly the same set of read and the same thing.
And one of the things I did just for diversity -- now we can write things with this context.
So here I have 100 percent of white plant that I try to hear people of the service of the partner.
But it gets -- I took this code -- the code has the leaders that we are used to use in this, and I wrote my environmental data in this DNA of the DNA and the particular 10 to 12 times.
And so if someone wants 100 million tons of my personal head I have a lot for all of the present -- in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a stage I would have put it into a virus and I would have been waiting for the room.
What was the next that?
So writing DNA was an interesting step there.
This made these cells were happy.
But then I happened another big interesting step in which things were getting very different, and it was that these cells started to interact and communicate information with the way of cells.
I don't know if you know, but the bacteria can interact DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved the responsibility to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid the personality and they were used to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of responsibility to the police because the bacteria are communicate to them.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together in the way, and they had a device.
And the way that they would save or worked together, or that if a community was very successful all of the communities of that community they were getting more and they were food for evolution of evolution for evolution of science.
And the police point happened when these communities came up so much that in fact, they came up and decided to write all the area of the community in a DNA.
And the next thing for life took other billion years.
And in that stage we have clear communities -- communities of many different cells working together.
In fact, we are a computer community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin of the skin is not going to be without the heart of the heart or the music, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and they put the more interesting levels than the cardiologist, something we call an organization we call an organization thing.
The next level is happening within these community.
These were starting to solve information information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than putting information in community.
These are the natural structure.
The neurons are the spaces that protect the information that those mobile communities built built together.
In fact, they were starting to spread inside the community being responsible to reduce, understanding and transform the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those community.
And that gave you an evolutionary advantage of it.
Because at that point as an individual -- the learning was connected to the death of an organization and not at the time of evolutionary time.
So an organization might be able for example, learning not to eat a freedom because I knew bad.
That could happen during the life of an organization because they had built these building structures of information that the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years.
So the fact that the nervous system is building those information structure structures that are very excited to the evolutionary process.
Because the evolution could now happen to an individual of an individual now.
It could happen in time to learn to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the control of the community.
So for example, the most decided version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention in it.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here that I was sitting up with a lot of gravity, and it would be able to build a similar idea -- it goes up and confidence, in their head that would be able to be able to be a sense with me.
But we take something very complicated we do it in sound in sounds of sound -- and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That will now allow us to start to work like an organization of it.
In fact, as a humanity we have started to make advantages.
We are now going through the similar organizations to the political organisms -- we put our own methods of crossing, private and information.
For example, the invention of the language was a little step in that direction.
The mechanism, the disease, the context, the CD.
And that tells us in something much bigger and it able to experience more than we did before.
Now the evolution can happen in sexuality.
And you saw the energy example of the exam that I made a certain evolution with the Congo Congo, in our eyes.
And now we've put the scale of time again.
The first stories of the story that they told them a thousand years old.
And the next one, the nervous system and the brain, I took a few hundreds of millions of years.
The next one, the language took less than a million years.
And the next one, as the electricity seems to take just a few decades ago.
The process is been adapted, I guess that arm is the right word to name something that makes their own change.
The more change, the more fast it is.
And I think that's what we're going to look at in this expert of the college.
We see the process.
But I have a life to design computers and I know that the mechanisms that I was going to do to try to design it not to be possible.
But now design objects of complexity that would be impossible for me to give them a different way to give them.
I don't know that it makes every deal in that machine machine machine.
There are thousands of dollars.
Instead of that, with the design of Twitter Maltes, we think of a level of advance, we put it in the machine and the machine with that makes something that you couldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to ever ever before.
In fact, sometimes they don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been used to do, is the same.
We put it into the machine an evolutionary process that goes in the scale of the seconds.
And for example, in the most extreme case, we can evolved a program from an open sense of institutions of institutions of it.
And we said, please get a number of millions of services of institutions in the airplane?
You can take these services of institutions in the love, to take all of those programs -- and take those of them that we want to do?
In other words, I mean what I want.
So let's say that I want to understand numbers to put a simple example.
And so we found the programs that are going to be able to understand numbers.
Of course, it is a little bit likely that a little bit of advanced services -- they make numbers -- so no one of them.
But one of them could make two numbers on the right brain.
And I said, computer. You could take 10 percent of those high sections that better did the task?
We're going to make those and we get the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it.
And now we make the people who are better to understand the numbers.
And we're going to be able to be able to put them up with a process of religion at the season.
Let's take two programs -- that you have children who are going to get survival, and that children will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a little bit of programs of them.
And so we get a new generation of the production of the programs that had a little bit more success.
And we said, please get the process.
And I came back again.
It takes a few machines.
And I tried to take it back and remember it with another generation of it.
Well, every generation takes a few reasons.
So I can do the equivalent for millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to understand numbers in absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient than that I could have written on a hand.
If you look at those programs I can't say how it works.
I've tried to be able to see how they work.
These are dark programs -- strange program.
But it turns out the food.
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a hundreds of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives need to do it.
And once I was in a 18-year-old with Mars Minister and he had a surgery and he says, "Look, I looked at this.
He says, "This area has hundreds of thousands of people who work together to make a very safe value. You don't feel that transportation?
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they get computers together.
So we began to design the computers to make a different design process.
And that allows us to produce things a lot more complex than that produce normal evolution.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes from us.
Now we use those programs to do much more quickly, and so we can make these programs much more quickly.
And it will be recorded.
The thing is going to go faster and so I think that it looks so construction.
Because all of these technologies are getting back.
We are defined.
And we are in a moment at the time of the cells when they became medicine.
We are the love and we can't understand what we are doing.
We are in the intervention point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very proud of our part to think that we are the final product of the evolution of evolution there.
And I think we all are part of the creative of what it will come from.
But now it comes the death, and I think I'm going to stop here before I get in.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I have taken enough enough to allow me to make a part of my favorite factory in that.
Before I treat the subject of my talk, let's talk a little bit of biology.
Why isn't it?
We are about the end of the end.
We love the biology, right?
The beauty is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
And it's going to go up with the robots -- I talk about the stars and they used to make a great team of blood.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you.
It is called the art arm.
And we talk about 300 of a battery that was based out of it.
And that means that the bank is expensive, two of 10 times.
So that means to take the village to the game of games without being a professional, and anyone who is trying to take it to the first base -- and the second thing is going to be saved to the signal.
There are three tests of 10, one.
You know how they call a 300 in the Great Linds?
Well, it's really good, maybe the team of the stars ...
You know what they call a bill of 440 percent billion?
By the way, that is someone who about 10 degrees -- it was about four.
Let's get -- like the Lego Tenning West, the last place of the Last majority of Liberia in the middle of Berting in a recent mile in a red team.
Now we put this to my world in the medicine where I feel much more changing, or maybe less implicit, after what I will tell you today.
They guess that they have adaptive and they are available to a surgery that has a street of 400 percent of them.
So it doesn't work, right?
They are now going to make you live in a strange place and one would be wanted to have two artists and its family of family and the family.
But you know what?
She is better.
And their car have been 18.
This is not work.
But I would ask you.
What do you believe that it must be the average of a care of a care control or consequence, from a neuron or a control or a control or a control or a control or a control of a college?
All right.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the air of a good surgery of a doctor or diagnosis.
What we do, though, is to find them to the world, and I get up, with the forest of being perfect people.
And I came up, you know, they eat a tradition and I think how to do it well.
That was the message that I used when I was in the middle of medicine.
I was a completely complicated thing.
One time on the high school said that Big Google was studied until a blood stage.
And so of course it is.
I was in my small stage in my small sense of the Human hospital of the Hollywood Honor of Alexander, not far from here.
And I learned all of a lot.
From my kind of analysis, I took the original and the magic work -- the speed of every car that comes out of the car -- the different difference of the reality and the not water.
And I even know the difference of the difference about how to change the collective terrorist.
And as so much more and more knowledge and more know.
And I was very good. I was going to get a lot of horizons.
And they came from the media school with the impact that if it was impossible, then I would know everything or the most powerful thing to all, because this is what it would look like.
And it worked for a time, until I met the David Dead.
I was a result in a college hospital here, in Taliban when they brought up to the Service Derek to the service service where I work.
At that point, I was going to get to the self-assembly service in that time.
And when it was used to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the patient of that patient to get up to that patient
And it will be able to be able to be able to go into it.
When I saw the David Darwin, I was going on.
I heard a sound sound.
And when I had the application, I heard a sound sound in both side -- what I was sent to me is a construction of control control.
And in these conditions the heart stop working and instead of moving the blood towards the boat, the blood goes to the planets, and that's why they have to go back, and that's why there is hard to respond for it.
And it was not hard to discovery.
I did it and I was going to work on the treatment I would know.
And he gave him an anti-independent and medicine to address the pressure in his heart.
He gave him distances, the water of water, so that I could be able to pick up.
And in one time or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there it was when I first started the first one.
In fact, I eat two more.
He sent her home without talking with the expectation of restaurants.
I didn't go back the phone and I did what I should have done, which was called my fish and turn it with him to see it.
And if my head would have seen it, I would have been able to support the complete information.
Maybe I did it for a good right.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resource that allows you to be a construction that I want to do.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to get responsibility that could be able to take my patients without even going to my liver.
The second theory that I found was worst was worst of it.
When I send it back to her house, I didn't put attention to a voice in my inside that told me, Google: it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so teach that until I asked the disease that I went to the Service Deada: "You think that's going to his house.
And the disease thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think will be good."
I remember that as if it was given it.
And so it was the street, and the relationship together with the discoveries came to their house.
And I went back to the room.
The rest of that day -- that later, I had a bad project in the stage.
But I went with my work.
At the end of the day, I started to leave the hospital and walk into the structure where I was my car to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do.
And I went through the service of the way to walk home.
And there is another number -- not that I did from the David Sentime before, but he told me three words -- those three words that most of the drugs are going on.
Other species are also, but there is a practice in energy and is that we see the public patients.
The three words are going to do is, right?
"I remember the patient that I send up to your house?
And I asked the other word with a very natural way.
And so she goes back and stay with the same one.
She was good.
But it comes back and go back to the death.
When I was a time of a time to go back to his house, then I was given the high -- I went up with a school and his family called the 1870s, the discoveries that they were going to extra experts with a 50 feet of Germany, what it means to be a sea sea.
And I was just going up and I was blue and was water.
The environmental person is all their resources.
They gave it a drug to get the critical pressure of it.
And they had an artificial responsibility.
And I was working up and happening up to the model.
I had a kind of sense of feelings because then they were going to be in terms of interview and hope against all hope that would be represented.
And in the two or three days of the next day I was going to never get up.
I had a brain brain diagram.
The family.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was happening.
And at the time I was going to be going to be going to go to the Deteruit Service, wife and mother and grandmother.
They say that they never have the name of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks I went up for it and experiment for the first time the shark rate that there is in our medical culture and I felt like that, but I felt that I would feel that blood strange because you can't talk to your colleagues because you can't talk to your colleagues with you.
You get the fish and never more to make it out there.
It is that window to leave a principal.
So the bad seat of what I talk about is what makes us feel very bad by inside inside it.
This is what it tells us that that we did that we did was bad.
And that felt sitting on.
And it was not for my eye, he was a fourth one.
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I had the things and you make sure that they didn't give me.
And I went up with those questions.
Why didn't I ask my eye? Why did I send her home.
And in my words, why did you eat a so much task?
Why did it get medicine?
It was a little bit of that feeling that was discovered.
And I started feeling better.
And in a single day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I asked me if I feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I record the effort to be perfect to not eat more extraction, would make those voices -- and I would go through those voices to make those video.
And so on.
I went back to work.
But I went back to happen.
Two years later, I was help in the experience of the impact in a community hospital at the North House, and I got a man of 25 years with a pain in the tradition.
I was very excited and surrounded by it.
And he would be here.
And he looked at his grandmother, I was a little bit.
And he had a little bit and I sent it to her house.
But as he was going to the door to be able to come up with his grandmother.
Two days later, when I came to make my care change -- my beach asked me to talk to me in his office in his office in his office.
And I tried the three words, right?
I remember the patient that I saw for a pain in the attack?
And he came back and I didn't have a static factory.
I had a completely moral approach called college.
You can find it in Google -- it's a infection, not the tradition, and the thing that can be able to cause the land of those go.
And he didn't make it.
And you have an old thing to go in, and it gets up to the few days.
And they went up with the same period of transformation and records, then I went back and go back to work, until he happened and again, and again.
twice in the same transition of creatures, we don't get detected.
And it's a big effort -- especially working on a hospital because it goes to 15 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them, I thought I had a really really really really been a really nice one.
They brain a record of records, but it turned out, a context that was getting up to the patient -- I was getting up to the patient in the bottom of the right and called the surgery.
The other patient was with a lot of design.
And he was going to bring it up to recognize and I asked my colleagues to get it out.
And then you get it up and by trying to make a certain sense in the right right right now, called the strategy.
And both of them were standing up and they were pretty well.
But every case I was given to me, I took me.
But I would like to tell you that I eat the world's worst five years in the first five years, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a performance.
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
It was just analyzed and without you.
And here is the problem -- if I can't read and talk about my entrepreneurs, if I can't find the video that tells me what it really is, how I could share this with my colors?
How do I teach you this for you to do the same transportation?
If I go to a place like this, I didn't have idea what you think about me.
When it was the last time you heard to someone to talk about factory, after factory, after factory?
Of course, in a room you hear to talk about the entrepreneurs of other doctors but not hear someone talking about their own extractions.
And if I came up and my colleagues as well, that a transport in my hospital took the wrong legs -- I think that I would have hard to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total business of the extractions.
It's the system that there are two positions: the ones that are going to make errors and the ones that you can't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have a result of results and the ones that have a results.
And it's almost like an American reaction -- as an antibiotics that start to support that person.
We have the idea that if we go out of medicine.
But that takes two problems.
It was about 20 years of distribution and decent decades, I have made a personal study of a bad doctor and doctors to learn how possible.
And what I learned is that the transportations are general.
We work on a system where the brains will happen every day, where one in one of 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong -- or the device is not right -- in a system where the international institutions are more and more, and more numbers and motion.
In this country, they die 24 dollars for electronics exceptions by electronics.
The United States of the United States was used 100 dollars.
In both cases, it was about closed substances, because we're not understanding the problem as we should be.
And so they're things.
A hospital system.
The property of the dream is going to be able to get all of the way.
And we can't get rid of it.
So we have the cognitive series that allow you to make a perfect story of a patient with a pain in the line.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the period -- it comes up with the limits with the sidewalks and with all of the state and suddenly my story is started with the description.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot -- I don't do the things.
And my patients are not cars -- they don't take your systems always in the same way.
And all of this, the transitions are invisible.
So if we take the system as they showed us, and we feed all of all the major professionals to the way, well, I'm not going to know anything.
And with it that people don't want to talk about their most bad cases to talk about their most bad case.
In my program, "Lings blood, art artist: it's already a concept to say, "This is my worst extraction? I'll say to everyone from the distances to the face of the care -- this is my worst service, "Look, blood, blood, blood, white to them.
And their students would say, they will go to the head and they will be able to go out and start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to say, "Look, they don't get the same brain?
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a scientific culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical medical is human -- it's human -- you know, and you don't have the energy of their extractions, but it turns out to learn how to teach each other.
I share his experience with them.
It's support for those who are talking about their errors.
It will be the teachers of other people who are not going to be able to go in, but in a certain way and the love and then so that all of them will benefit up.
And I work in a medical culture that I recognize that human beings to do the system, and when this happens -- they are going to make teachers rather than when it comes to when it comes to when it comes back in when it comes into the when it comes to when it comes to when it comes into it.
My name is Brazil George.
I am a developing doctor here.
I am human -- I can be able to be able to grow up.
And I feel a lot but I feel a lot about learning something that can transform others.
I don't know what to me, but I can live with that.
And let me focus with three personal words, I remember it.
You know how many decisions we take one day.
Do you know how much we have to get a week.
It makes a little bit of a stage to more than 2,000 people and the number of choices that he says to play an average American -- it's about 60 percent a day.
It doesn't do a lot in a research for a week to a week to a group of companies.
The researchers were able to get the different transportation of the distributions and the time that they were going to be able to make decisions with those deals.
They found that, in the way, they put 11 jobs per week.
Nature, every job is including a lot of microbes.
The half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just about 12 percent one time or more of your time.
Now you think about your choices now.
You know how many of the nine minutes.
How do you make the way that does those decisions mean?
Now, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the access," to choose to the supercondition of options.
I want to talk about the problem and a few social possible.
As I talk about this I'm going to give you a few questions and I need to know their answer.
When I ask a question, as I am a field, you get your hand only if you want to be able to be able to be able to be careful.
In the other way, when you do a question, if your answer is particularly particularly a parent.
And now my first question of day, you're ready to hear the problem of the relationship of advantages?
Thank you.
This is a particular study of the University of Steven, I was able to have this local level of very, very high at least at that time it was very strategy.
It's called Denmark.
It was almost like I go to a couple of fun.
There were like 2,000 different kinds of metaphorical and live, more than 500 different types of forces and variations and a few percent of water, and this was when we took water water water.
I would love to go to that sign, but in a room I asked me, why never never buy anything.
So this is the state of the activity of attention.
They had more than 15 different colleagues -- including the ones who were in the box that they come out of the military trees of them.
Once I decided to visit the Great and I asked him, "I work well this study of provided all these states?
And he would take me all the bad flowers that came up with every day.
We decided to make a little experiment with the brains.

They had 30 different kinds of different.
We started a piece to do, right at the end of the terror.
We put out there about six distances, or 24 different diagrams and we looked at two things -- first, what the people who are willing to be willing to try to stop the beautiful?
And more people were told when there was 27 -- about 80 -- that when there was only six percent.
We also look at the case that they were more likely to buy a terrorist transport.
So here we find the collective effect here.
So what they were told when there was 23 -- only three percent of it will be able to buy memory.
What they found when there were six -- we saw that 30 percent.
If we do the colleagues, people had six times more likely to buy if you found six of them that if they found 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy it probably we are going to probably come to us -- -- less is good to make the line -- but it turns out that the problem of the computer will be able to do in the rest of the terrible development.
We decided not to decide -- even when this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial sign.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with Grand Hunry, California Kanny and World John, where we look at the decisions about the control of a million Americans for a million of this country.
We were interested to see if the number of factors available in places of adults for corruption, the 3D program: 30 people to save the future.
And we found out that there was a condition.
We had 75 planets that were going on from two -- to four different opportunities.
And we found that the majority of factories was the number of free factors, there was less patients.
So if we look at the them, we see that in the plants that grow two words, the rate rate was about 80 percent or more, not as high as it is.
And in the plants that they were able to get about 60 degrees -- the rate rate of the device made up to 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decided to participate -- when there are more opportunities.
So for those who decided to participate -- how much the number of other people were interested for to avoid the attention or the financial factors.
In the time there were more choices -- they were more willing to find out in the top of a market.
But none of these amazing decisions are the ones that we remember to support the future.
In the last decade we have seen three main new negative contents in the most powerful and more possible.
The most likely thing is that it takes the decision -- which is even when this is going on against the own interest of the Internet.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions -- in the food and in the health.
They are more likely to play less satellites, even though it goes better.
The main reason is that we are going to look at that giant value of marriage, sea, living and financial, but we are not able to do the cost to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
I want to put you four simple techniques that we have tried -- in a way or other, in different research, so that they can be able to teach in their business.
The first is, Carrier.
You already heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is more.
People always move up when I say, "Wow!
They care about space in the analogy.
But what we're looking at is that we are looking at more and more is that if you decided to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be an increase in the viruses -- and they will be a better experience in the choice
And when I provide and Google went out of 24 different types of Kenya and San Alice, you saw an increase of 10 percent of them.
And when the government Colony was able to choose the products for deaths that are less sold -- they took the chances in percent.
You know that the surfaces of today, in average comes up 35 products of products there.
And in a sea of Washington, they grow up about 100 products in the course of it.
But the northern seat is bigger in the current world in the right world is Alika and it has only 15 products -- a kind of transparency task.
In the world, I think one of the best examples that have been done about how to bring the choices of David Mars, the Parkinson's program.
And all the employees of Harvard are used directly to a source of life.
They really want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get 20 forms, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to cut up.
All of these are important options?
The first thing I do is to ask the experiments, let's tell you the differences that there are between those chances.
And if your companies can't do it, they can be able to do their climates?
This later, before I start to start to be talking to Garden.
He told me that it would be willing to get the people from this audience a little bit of values with all pay to the most beauty of the world.
So here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to go up with a card if you're ready to take the dance of Gandhi.
(Audience: All right. All right.
Are they aren't it?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a structure.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think it's actually going to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first right, which in the second one, but I can go up and say that they thought that the second time it was more true.
Because the images made it more real.
So this brings me to the second technical to keep the problem of the police possible that is constantly.
And so people understand the differences between oceans -- they have to understand the consequences of every day, and that the consequences must be a very long way -- very construction.
Why do people have 15 to 30 to 30 percent in average when you use open adults or creation, that when you use effect?
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it faster -- it can be a very positive tool for people to save people more.
And we did a study with Shanghai British and Alexander English, on the institution of Indus -- that they were working in New -- these people were in a region where they were going to a 404 plan of a planet.
And to that record, we're going to get exactly how we address it, we did a little discovery.
What we learned was that we put it to the people who thought about the positive things that will happen in their lives if they were more money.
And with this mission there was an increase in the excited 20 and an increase in the amount that were interested to save or in what they wanted to put in the top of the subjects of services, four four four percent of them.
The third technical is Electronic.
We can make more causes that you can do.
For example, this is a study that we did in a piece of records.
And we saw that in the New Wars at the face of the Angeles, the record of records can get from 180 different types to 17.
But you know?
Because the ability to get me how to do it.
These are two experts of streets.
One is called "The "Line and the other, "State?
If you think that the left is San and the right of the right is Japan, they're going to be a paradigm.
(Audience: Well, there's some of them.
If you think about the left of the left is Japan and the right of the right is San, you get a paradigm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The left on the left is Japan and the right is Starch. But you know something.
So this school of climate is completely incredible.
The cars have to do something to who specialize -- not that it makes them.
And you often see this problem with those huge lists of food.
What would you see who are they dead?
My fourth careers, considerable the complexity of it.
It turns out that we can make a lot more information than what we think about, if we just give it a little bit of a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity of it.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's look at a very complicated decision -- the buy of a car.
This is a fantastic factory of cars that allows you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it up.
You have to take 60 decisions to make the car.
And these decisions will go in the number of choices that shows each one.
The course of the car -- I have 45 possible.
And I mean, back of change.
What I'm going to do is that I'm going to make the order that the decisions are.
So half of the colleagues are going to go from a lot of opportunities.
The other half of the elements are going to go from a little bit, four pounds -- for 24 colleagues -- many options.
And what am I going to look at it?
What is so going to be going to be involved with you.
If you get the back of the record in every decision in every decision -- this means that they are adapted, or is, we're losing them.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to a little bit of devices -- they will look at the baby for a day and again, and another time.
We lost them.
If you go out of people who are going to go to many, they got there.
The same information -- the same number of opportunities.
The only thing I did was to forget the order in which the information.
If you start with the easy -- you would learn to support.
Even though the cost of change is not saying anything about the early decision, in all of our way that we were going to have to get up to elect.
It uses us a product that we're building that now we have more of us with the process.
In order to go.
I've talked about four techniques to improve the problem of the professors of the disaster of the disaster of the disaster of the disasters -- control, will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make up, to make it a real thing to make a little bit of controls with less opportunities.
All of these techniques that I've got to be designed to help the automobiles, or better for you, to use them to use it in their things, or for people who are going on.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being able to be able to be able to go down.
And the more expensive we will be in our better.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the United States, if you had a writing machine.
I had to reduce a little bit of an example of an example with the machine.
And this is so that the government could be able to make the original of the seasons.
If you found a written with the resource message they could be able to face the short to the origin of the idea.
In the West we didn't think that someone could do this, so much that it would take the street of experience.
We will never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2008, if you buy a whole company of any big food of any big one, and imagine a page -- that piece would end up by having a little bit of parallel plants in every piece that they get a pattern that makes them a pattern that makes them a pattern of one and their principle.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to take a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our government used technology in against us, the cities.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the world in the world we can add the adults on their adults.
There are three main groups.
They are the crimes.
Like Mr. Deney's Google of the city of Nick, in Rose.
The cell of the crisis is very easy to understand it.
These guys make money.
They will be able to make a lot of money.
There are a lot of millions of millions of millions of miles on the line.
This is Toron Talk, from Talk Talk.
This is All George George.
This is South Waller.
This is Big State.
These are Mars Anderson: Turkey and so on. etc.
And these guys make their forests on the line, but they do it by the right media to bring the money of the money of our contents when we buy it in the line, or the key of our key to get our forests when we buy in a computer computer.
The U.S. service of the United States, a few months ago, I know the surface of this book, San Japan, and this is 18 million dollars when it was survival.
Dr. Japan was considered with his parent.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us being a version of a real understanding of a real way.
And it is very obvious that this is going to be a bad thing.
In the future, most of them will happen in light.
The second group of adults that we look at today is not killed by money.
There is another thing you move -- they move them through the protect -- you can move them through the opportunities, they move the restaurants.
Thank you like Antarctications have been discovered in the last 12 months going up a paper in the airports on the line.
Those are the three percent primary three-dimensional, the creatures that do it for money, the marketing as animals that do it to protect and the last group of the government are the global the governments that they do.
And then we see things like Denmark.
This is a good example of a global heart against their own cities.
You can say is a piece of activity of the World countries, and actually, it was.
And he was going on the last time because of a state.
It sounds out the security security of the site and they lost a career.
The last week I asked -- in a record with a resource of the human government -- I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people on the access to the access to Deney.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people move out of a street of this?
It is a criminal authority.
They sell critical.
Why do the crimes look like?
Well, you need if you have a website with hypertensions, services Electric Electors, services like Galaxy.
And I have been able to make an open authority of an open article.
And that they are going to be able to be able to be able to be actively controlled.
And in the case of Daniel happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Earth and those things that have happened for example, in England?
Well, in America the sharks were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to open in the open of 2010, and during the side of the building, they found a lot of paper.
And between those countries was this care called CO2?
And within that car there was notion of a company with service that had been sold to the American government to figure out a lot of the communities of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 24 dollars to the English government.
The number of the company is right here.
Or it is, the Western governments are going to put up tools to governments so that they will do this to their cities.
But the Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Alexander, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the speed of the speed of the speed of the Global government in order to invest their own cities.
If you're responsible in a good case, it's pretty obvious that their phone is investing.
But today it goes over there.
It was interested to the Internet.
They will use even tools like the state used to identify our computer with a train to allow us to see all the communication and listen to the design of the light, to get our data.
When we think about things like these most obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like something bad -- but I actually don't affect me because I'm a human city.
Why would we worry about.
I don't have anything to carry?
And that argument has no sense.
It is in game policy.
It is not designed.
This is not a question of the practice against security.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could be able to trust our governments today in 2008, any right that we are going to do today, it will be for always forever.
And we have been done in any future government in a destination that we could have about 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live -- I live in Kenya.
These are the values of my car, at the bottom -- and behind the background, the National Park of National.
The National National Park does not have close in the biggest part of the south -- what it means is that animals that are straight as the marketing books of the park.
And you know, as the lessons -- and this is what they do.
They kill our dance.
This is one of the ones who were killed by the night, and so soon we came back in the morning and we found it a lot of it was very bad.
My community, the machines, we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to put it, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of the legal.
They move them out of them that protect our community and the hot -- and they're also moving with the problem.
And so they kill lessons.
This is one of the six dollars that they killed in Allian.
I think this is why I think there is so few in the National Park of National.
A year in my community, in the age of nine years -- it's responsible for the side of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire because I thought I was afraid to fear them.
But I realized that this is actually not going to be, because I even helped the willing to see the state of the bottom.
I don't remember me.
A second idea was to use a space.
I was trying to get the laws so that they think it was close to it.
But the laws are very smart --  they came up with the first day and saw the spirits, and the second day, but the second day, and they said, and they said, this thing doesn't move here.  And so they came up and they went up and they did animals.
So one night I was walking around the state with a car and that day the laws didn't come in.
I found out that laws have fear to the light that it moves down.
So I had an idea.
And I got a interaction that I will understand and to get the lights out.
And this is a little bit of a robot leader.
And it was all right.
And as you can see, the solar piece is going up with the bacteria and the bank of the electricity to the little individual box -- I call it a transportation.
And the industrial box makes the discovery of the device.
As you can see, you can give them out there, because that's where the laws come from.
And that's how you see it when you see it when they come from night.
The light lights and start to the laws to think that I'm walking on the state, but I'm getting in my way.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have the problems with the lessons with the laws of them.
And the houses of the network gave the idea.
One of them is from this battery.
And she had taken a lot of animal animals and asked me if I could put the light.
I said I know.
And you can see it -- you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lessons.
Since then, I've got them in seven house in my community and they're being getting a lot.
And my idea is also used now by the whole World -- to support other designers like daughters, lesson, and it also is using to save the elements of free.
And thank you to this invention -- I had the way to get a little bit in one of the best schools in the best schools from Kenya, Brazil Technology, and I'm very excited for me.
My new school is now going to get back to the bottom and consumer.
I even took my friends to my community and we put light in the house that you don't have them, and I show you how to get them.
So, a year ago, it was just a child in the stars of the sport of my father, and I used to see the value to come out and told me that some day would be within one.
And today I'm here.
It got the opportunity to come in for the first time at the first time.
My big dream is to be able to be an engineering of anti-stars and playing when I grew up.
I used to get the lessons, but now as my invest is save to the coasts of my dad and the laws -- we can be with the leaders without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict with any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any conflict without any
And what I think in my language means -- thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So I got a bit of a blue. Richard Turk: Yeah.
CA: You are working on other electric invention here.
What's the next one in your light?
DP: My next invest is -- I want to make a celebration of electricity. CA: A class close?
MT: I know they were invented by the electric cars, but I want to do the me.
CA: So I do it once one time, right?
We're going to add in every step in every step that you do, friend me.
Thank you very much. LG: Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up with a song called "No analogy nature?
And I felt very proud to me.
In school, we spent all the time by studying the story of John Minister, but we had never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, June in the South -- Japan is the emotions.
Even though I sometimes asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North of the North -- until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public recently.
But I thought that my life in North North North was normal to do.
My family was not poor and myself had never been hard.
But one day, in 1998, my mom brought home a letter of my sister in my sister in my sister here.
He said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop to exist in this world, because we have no food in the last few weeks past.
We are released together in the floor. And our bodies are so difficult, that we are prepared to move to move."
And I was very statement.
It was the first time I heard that people were getting up in my country.
At the time when I was walking back to the state of try and I saw something terrible that I can't get out of my memory.
A woman without life was died on the street, and it was going to be a high school in their arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one had them -- because they were very concerned to do these things and their family.
And a huge amount of articles at the North North at the middle of the age of the 1950s.
At the end, more than a million night died during the hand and just a few of us who were going to be able to find past, institutions and transformation control.
They also made more and more finding the energy.
I always asked me why they had light and us.
This is a solution picture of North North in the night in the night with the new countries.
This is the Arab Gore, which comes out between North North and China.
And as you can see, the river can be very anti-start in certain points -- allow me to be able to create a secret of security.
But many die.
Sometimes I see bodies coming on in the floor.
I can't get the details of how I came from North North North but I can only tell you that for the years of the health I was sent to China to live with a little bit of back.
But I just thought it would be surprised from my family for time.
I could never have imagine that I would take 14 years to come to live together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like Nigeria.
But I just learned that it's not just extremely difficult -- but it also dangerous -- because the normal resources in China were being able to be able to be considered income.
This was what I was living with a realize that my identity was recovered, and it would be released to a straight destiny of the North North Colony.
One day, my worst discovery was actually made up by the China.
Some of them had been able to be a number, then they were made my skills in the Chinese language and made me a lot of questions.
And I was a room.
I thought my heart was going to explain me.
If I didn't seem to be carefully, it could be released and destruction.
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I want to control my emotions and the questions.
And at the end of the institution of a child he said to others, "This was a bad response.
And they let me go to me, it was a mile.
Some of them in China are looking at the subject in front of the extra forests.
But a lot of you can be killed by the Chinese police and demonstrate.
These women had a lot.
Even though you have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be an international pressure after an international project.
These night, they didn't have a lot as much as well.
Every year, they were able to be taken in China and decided to North Corpotees, where they are transportation, record or public primes.
Even though I was applied to spend, a lot of other hours have not had so much.
It's traditional that the neurons have to cut up their identity and fight so hard just to come out.
Even after learning a new language.
That's why you know, after 10 years of changing my identity -- I've decided to be able to go back to the South of the South surface.
And I started a new life again.
And I'm going to be able to be able to be a lot of the South was a lot of a lot of what I was on.
The English was very important in the South of South Africa, I had to start to learn my third language.
And also, I found that there was a great gap between North and Sun.
We are all control, but in the way, we've got to be very different because of 75 years.
Even you get an identity crisis in it.
I'm South or north?
What am I doing? Who am you?
And so there was no country that could call me with me with me.
And even though I was going to be able to life in the Sun of the South wasn't easy -- I made a plan -- I started study for the beginning of income to the University of universe.
Just when I started taking my new life, I got a call called a called a chemical call called it.
The North North North North was made some money that I sent to my family -- and as a career, my family was going to be used to the force to a release access to the outside of the out.
They had to be able to be able to be able to be able to get up.
So I started to plan how to help you spend.
The night is going to work long things in the way towards the land.
It is almost impossible to create the front between North North and North Country.
And so, I took a fly to China and I went up to the front of the North North of North North North.
Because my family couldn't be able to talk about, I had to take you, in some way, for more than three thousand miles through China and then through the surface of Africa.
The journey in cars took a week, and we almost went up with several times.
Once our car was designed and deal with a profit of the Chinese population.
And I was asked to go out of all.
As my family could not be able to understand China, I thought my family was going to be a straight.
And when the Chinese activity came up to my family, I was impossible to ask me, and I said that they were software people who was going on.
And I looked at me, but then I looked at me.
We did all the way to the forest of Latin.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to go to the free free in Latin.
But even after I was going to go up with it, my family was stream and record to create the front forest.
After pay tasks and robots, my family.
But at the time, my family was adapted and record over the career of Latin.
This was one of the biggest points in my life.
I did everything to take my family and we were so close to my family -- but my family was made up in private to the control of the South Control of South Corporation.
I was going and came in between the original office and the police room, particularly trying to take my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bottoms or colleagues.
I lost the hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem.
I was so surprising that a designer would matter to question.
With my English English and with a discovery, I was going to tell you the situation -- and yet the man was to the number of money and gave me the rest of money for my family and for other two hours and to be able to provide it.
And I was thank you with all my heart, and I said, "Why does it help me.
I'm not going to help you, he said.
I'm going to help the neighborhood people?
I realized that that was a simple moment in my life.
The yellow was a new hope for a new hope for me and for the black village when we needed it.
And I showed you that the baseball of the conversations and the support of international community are really the hope of hope that the black village needs to.
With the time, after our long journey and my family and I were left in the South South Africa.
But to get your freedom is just half the balloon.
A lot of news are supported from their family and when they take a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
And so we can learn from the international community with education, practice of the English.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North North and the rest of the world.
Because many of us get in contact with families still inside and we put information and money that is helping to change the North North from the North before.
I have been very excited -- I have been a lot of help and inspired in my life, so I want to help to help a chance for an opportunity to protect an international support of an international support of interactive.
I'm sure you are going to see more and more black and more nerve in the whole world, including in the TED.
Thank you.
And I live in Central South in South America.
So this is California States, the teams of the limits, food food.
And so the plants of the city came up and thought, we're going to change the name of the South Sun so that it turns out something else -- so they changed it to the South Americans -- as if this is really wrong in the city.
So this is the American Americans --  -- literature food, food food, the bad teams.
And the same thing that 84 million other American lives live in a desk of food, the American American players, home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The thing is that the food places to take more people than the food in the car.
People are dying from dark diseases in the Arab center of the surface American.
So for example, the rate rate in my network is five times greater than we say, "Look at Hillians, which is like 15 miles away.
I'm going to see that this happened.
And I asked me, how would they feel if they didn't have access to food food.
I see signals of grandmothers and sell as car cars as well.
I see control centers like States.
And I think this has to stop it.
I know the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And so I was able to get 45 minutes of company and come back to buy a field that has no performance.
What I did was to put a forest of food to my house.
In a land of land we call a horse.
It's about 45 feet is three me.
The point is, it feels to the city.
But you have to share it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come on in it, because it's my responsibility and I have to take it out.
This was how I decided to tell it.
And so my group and I, Leonardo, George Greenesting, we found and we started to put our food of food.
What we do, we are kind of a group of groups that have been able to put through the content of all the proteins, all the city and completely value and everything we do is great.
And the battle, I was beautiful.
And then you would get out of it.
And the city came up with me and in terms of me gave me a car said that I had to get my brain, the care was made by collaboration.
And I said, "We said, right?
A college order to put it up in a piece of land that no one matter --  -- and so I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, he was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, he was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, I
Because this time was not going to happen.
Laster, Times had the story written by Steve Link, and I was talking to the concept and one of the members of Greenland Grandmothers, who had a relationship in China, and it was a success.
We had the video in our hands.
My concept was even called to say that they went up and see what we were doing.
I mean, you know, why not?
Look at it is the U.S. city with more based transportation.
It has 78 miles of the banking terrorists.
And that is about 20 Peraction Parkinson.
That is enough enough to put 18 million plants of the balloon.
Why do you hear it doesn't look like this?
It will be able to do a thousand to make a few thousand dollars.
When a pain of governments will give you 15 dollars of results.
It's my Hill, when I say to people -- culture your own food.
It will control your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a limitation for South South.
I grew up there. I grew up to my children there.
I'm going to be part of this fact that it was management to me for me, and I'm going to keep my own reality.
You see, I'm an artificial thing.
The horse is my face, I was my artist.
And as a piece of marketing, that makes the walls -- I would take them up, holes.
It uses the back, the land -- as a piece of leadership, and the plants and the trees and the trees are my understanding of that time.
They feel like to see what the land can do. If you leave it to be your limit.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is that it is a show and how they affect people.
What happened?
I am a text of how my goal became a tool of education, of the transition of my neighbor.
To change the community, you have to change the compassion of the land.
We are the land.
It was amazing to see how the kids.
The guide is the most typical access and profit that you can do, especially in a grandmother.
And also, you get a feature.
I remember a chance, who came up a mother and his daughter -- they were like the 1980s of the night and they were in my floor, and they were going to look at a lot of advantage.
I me, well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a right.
I felt to see the people who was so close to me, and this only requires why I do this, people ask me, "Yes, you don't tell me that people are going to go to your food?
And I say, "The God no, I don't fear that they are going to go to relationship?
So that's in the street.
That's what it is.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to take your health health?
There was another attention that I put up a back in a research in the center of the American Arabic.
They were these guys -- they helped me to stop the food.
It was familiar -- I was shared by his stories about how this had affect them and how they used to plan with his mom and her bone, and it was great to see how this changed them, so it was just for a moment.
And so George Green has come back to plan maybe 20 streams.
We've had -- as about 50 people who come in, work and particular, all of the local plants.
If the criminal kids -- the kids will end up here.
So if you make a transportation, I will eat them.  But if nothing of this will teach you, if you don't teach them how the food is the mind of the mind and the body, they started to blind what they put them in front of it.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are addressed. I see girls of color that are in this way designed for them, which doesn't take them at all.
With the context, I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting out of their communities to have a survival life.
And when we do this, who do you know?
You may be producing the next George World World.
But if we don't change the combination of the Earth, we never do it.
Now this is one of my plants. This is something I want to do.
I want to put a whole piece of data, where people can share food.
I want to take you together and turn them into high careers.
They don't get me.
I'm not talking about things -- because it is not surprising.
And the top of the subjective is that you have to be.
And what I talk about is to be able to work to people, to take the kids of the street -- that you know the forest, the proud and the honor to control their own food and open market market market market.
So what I want to do here, we have to do it.
And I want you all to become an education records in education, general controls.
We have to change the mountain of what's a gold.
If you're not a horse, you're not a general.
And the galaxies will take your country right?
And that is your electricity theory.
You know, if you want to go to me with me, well, if you want to see, I don't find me if you want to sit in the same camera and have decisions to talk about making some -- to talk to you a lot -- to talk to you a look at some way.
If you want to see, they come back to the back with your way so that we can put something like that.
people. Thank you.
Thank you.
(March --   (Audience --  -- are probably all going to be able to agree with me that this is a very nice way.
It's made of transport, and the apple is a good material to deal, but not always not in days as today, where it takes a lot.
You can have a great amount of water in the market that soldiers.
And especially if you go together in your bacteria and these cars spend -- that's not very much.
And also, the advantage can do a lot of room.
It's a fundamental material and if we build careers, like in the United countries -- very close to cities, we would want to be a static career.
So the solution for that is to make a little bit of oil factors.
And the strange thing, a material that we use now in the majority of the Colomberations of the Congortes -- it has heard and the water can go through it, so all the water water will go up to the side and have a car that is easy to continue, and not more water.
The robot is also going to be going to stop in these people.
Because it is very soon -- all of the route is going to be able to be able to be a very simple control.
It also has work, of course, and the death of this box is that you can be able to get up.
What is it defined? You see that in the surface of the surface the surface are coming out.
First of all, you know, a lot more and more and more and so on. And then then I don't do that.  But you can give them their walls, and you can not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more data.
Sometimes you can create bacteria with that.
There it is.
But back, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the day in this materials.
It is a little bit of profiles, as I said, so it only has a little amount of advantage between the lands.
Because of the institution, to the Lincoln light.
So if you go up on the career, you get the artists -- as we saw it here.
In order to solve this problem, we thought about material materials.
If we can make this material that we have to be able to have a solution.
And so what we can do is use the author market, of that to be able to be able to be able to be able to take it in a very small way, and we can imagine those little states with the beauty.
And so we have a little bit with little parks of the head on it.
And then you need a machine that you see here, that you use to get a common machine machine.
The researchers can be able to be able to be able -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to make the car, demonstrated the battle, the brain will feed for these matters and the particles will look at the surface of the surface.
I'm going to use a microbes today because I can't bring the great machine machine.
The mind of microbes is a similar system.
I put the study, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the shows that comes now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to make the streets.
We put a lot of shows up there and then the government, they actually saw our results -- and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try it.
So they gave us a little bit of care, 400 feet of the 1870s that we had to make a control of trial to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to be able to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to be
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the way, and then of course, this face will take a lot of years without any day -- that's what we know about the practice of it.
We took a lot of shows of this face and we put them on the lab.
We made the stores, we put a lot of close in them, we would do it then we would do it then with our computer machine and we're going to get them and get them back to it.
We can remember this a lot of times.
Well, to continue, I can tell you that we've done a material using care faces, including these faces, using the energy energy to actually increase the life of the surface of the surface -- even they can save a lot of money with very simple.
And now, of course, they have quality of whether this also works.
We still have the shows here -- it's pretty complete.
In fact, you have to focus on the first before you can show you how it can be able to show it.
But I'm going to make a attempt to make a attempt here.
Let's see. Yes, it works.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember that I would have developed a morning with the sound in my house.
My father was listening to nine neurons in her little room.
I had a big place in his face that was used in those time, because news are going to do it.
"The tasks were going to be gotten up with my father.
I didn't know what I mean, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
Now I know you can go to a real school, he said.
A morning.
A green school.
You see, I was six years old when the tasks were put from Afghanistan.
For the next five years, I looked like a child to put my sister more -- that I could not be out there, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we were able to focus on.
Every day, we took a different car so that no one could tell where we are.
We had to cut the books in the markets of the market so that it seemed to be working.
The school was in a house, more than 100 percent of us address in a small room.
It was gravity in the invention but extremely expensive in summer now.
We all knew that we were looking at our lives.
And once in the when the school was going to be responsible for a week, because the substance states.
We always asked us what they knew from us.
And they were going to do that?
Do you know where we live in.
We were advanced, but yet the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was a leader and the daughters a universe.
My grandmother was an extraordinary man for his time.
And a total control of an African property of Afghanistan. I was born that his son, my mother went to school, and that's why his father does it.
But my father mother became a metaphor.
This is it.
It's going to go back two years ago, only to become our house in school for girls and women in our neighbor.
And my father, this is the first of all his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to get education, even their children -- despite the transportation, despite the research.
And for him, there was a bigger risk in not education their children.
For the years, I remember that there were moments where I was very happy by our life, and I was always standing up and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to get up, but my father said, "Oh, I did me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can break your money. You can work on your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our solution to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you don't want not to get up?
I have 12 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been developed by the decades of war.
So less than seven percent of the women in my age have more than the bank, and if my family didn't have been so excited with my education, I would be one of them.
In change, I found me here that I was able to get in Maria College.
When I came to Afghanistan -- my grandmother -- which was explain from her home for the way to explain his children, was one of the first ones in the factory.
He doesn't just be able to get my college rate but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman who took it down by the streets of Kan.
My family believe in me.
I was going to be a big one, but my family has even more big cars for me.
That's why I am the global job of 1950, a global field to measure women.
This is why I completely come to Senator, the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan. A country in which is still risk for the girls going to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong wish to take the opportunity.
And I see his parents and his families that like the me, and I was going through them, and even in the front of a designed opportunity.
As America. It's not your name of it, and I can't show you his face -- but today is the father of one of my students in my students.
So less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going to go out from Stanford to his village -- and literally they were used to be killed by a bomb in the way, for minutes.
When you get back to your house, they are the phone -- a voice I found that if I went to send his daughter to school, they will try to try it.
Let me take you up -- if you want it, he said, "You don't give the future of my daughter for his old old ideas?
What I've got to tell you about Africa, and it's something that is a huge thing in the West -- is that behind most of the people who came up, there is a country who had the value of her son and you see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are the first early international future of the future, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan -- we need the support of men.
under the tasks, the girls who were going to school in hundreds of hundreds of hundreds -- remember that it was complete.
But today, over three million children go to school.
Afghanistan.
I found the Americans see the factors of change.
I think that these changes don't be a lot -- after the rest of the U.S.
But when I go to Afghanistan when I see the students in my school and his parents who are able to get for them, I see a future future and a modern change.
And for me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and political countries, and every day the SIY children will tell me.
Like me, they get a big one.
Thank you.
I never have forget the words of my grandmother I died in the same same thing -- "Hey, it goes up to Galley.
But you never come back to you a straight revolution in the operation.
They have been almost two years since it was the brain revolution inspired by the state of traditional moral moral revolution as much as the English.
A forces with a lot of other limitations -- within and outside of the country to call a day of force and start a revolution against the trade train of David.
And we did it. It was a big revolution.
women and young men were in the visualization, to be able to get out of the recently, by getting out of freedom, discovery and social system.
They have shown a way that we have to get the farmer degree of death.
You have shown a great sense of software from the Middle thing, to the surface, to the Sure.
And finally, after a period of six months of straight war and a little bit of about about 50 dollars away, we were going to take our country and bring it into the way.
And yet, Gabby left a care past, a local legacy, computer and sea seasons.
For four decades, the Maria record of David designed the infrastructure and the culture and the moral structure of the full society.
And the consequence of the device and the challenges -- I've got a lot of other women, to reduce the civil civil society -- taking a transportation and right transportation to democracy and national relationship.
They were able to be able to be about 200 organizations in Bangladesh -- and increase after every single thing about David, about 300 in Temace.
After a 35 years, I went to Limb and I went to Lincoln and with a unique environment, I started to organizations about the development of ability and distributions of leaders.
With an amazing group of women we were able to find the Philadelphia's Portugues by Polie, a movement of women.
I found it with a very difficult way in the present period -- an environment that was increasingly more likely to be more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the discovery of diagnosis and experiment.
With time, our investigation was standing up and expensive.
The women went up to a 17 percent of the National Congo in the first 3.
However, a little bit of electronics and the revolution as one everything, they were defined -- all the days we found news.
So one day we would focus on the news of the old states of old states and survival substances.
Another day I took with the news of the United States of the United States and the authority at the time.
And another day we would go up with the news.
And every day, every day we set up with the government of the microscopes and their lives of the human rights of the pressure and their factory of the law of the law.
So our society, for an economic mental mental mind, and it has come out of the ideas and principles of the land, and a lot of social solution, that we had the first one.
And the intervention, the except and the subject became the cost of the revolution.
I'm not here today to try to you with our story of the success of the success of the signal and the electrons.
And so I'm here today to trust you that we -- as a nation -- we got wrong.
We didn't have a well.
Because the elements didn't take the peace and the solution and the solution to Lincoln.
The list of the concern and the alternative between care and cars were able to be peace and nature relationship?
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then.
Why do our society is going to be able to put out and standard with political political political policies and except for men as for women.
Maybe what you find was not just women, but the fundamental value of compassion and metaphorical and evolution.
Our society needs the national diagram and the design of thinking more than the colleagues -- that only they were able to break the police and discovery.
Our nature needs the quality of the fact that it is more than it needs to be the number of individual and quality of it.
We need to leave us to act as you get to act and call it to go to work.
We need to start to act as a computer of compassion and memory.
We have to develop a fundamental device that not only tools -- but it also put up the metaphorical instead of the breast, the control instead of compassion -- the evolution instead of experimental.
These are the ideas that a Line, built by the war -- it needs to be directly with the end of the peace to reach the fish.
Because the piece has an area that is about the interest and the attack between the fundamental perspective.
That is the true thing.
We need to figure out that in a strange way before we do it in a magical way.
And I remember with a version of the Carol "Supercomputer "percent, is the word of the microscope -- "Architects, compassion?
At the time, the word "the word is known in all of the adult traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional transportation, it has the same reason in red that the word "States: supporting the memory and moral thing, which is going to go to the whole humanity of the men and all of the people who all brought them up and all the people who all brought up and all the
And so, just like the theory is completely the end, which grows in it, which is growing in the diagram of the computer compassion all the existence all the way.
This is what it tells us, "My memory will take all of the things.
This is how it tells us -- "My mind protect about my warned?
That all of them are going to tell the market of the Middle.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a simple question -- which has a simple answer that has just been able to be able to be able to.
This is about the secret of magical violence and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody else is -- why are she going to do that?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who has been particularly?
I'm not a physical, or a social work, no experience in documentary violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that will tell you.
I was 12 years old, I was just going to get up in the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writing and the end of the English record.
I had my first paradigm, my first green Arab African Africa, and I had a very big secret here.
My secret was that many, a lot of times, the man, that I created my high school, I was told to the head with a pill, carrying with a short street.
The man, which I saw more than nobody in this world, I put a professor in my head and I was not going to get more times than I can remember it.
I am here to tell you the story of "The "Line "Here: a political architecture, and a love of love -- where every year every year of women and even a few men.
until it could be his story.
I don't seem to look like a surface of the democratic violence of the family.
I am recorded in University of the University of Harvard and I have a Michael in Mars from the William Benchilian Senator.
I have spent most of my career working for the classroom of the list "Boy: "Beautiful by them Johnny -- John Bond and The World Wall.
I took almost 20 years on my second half and we have three children.
My dog is a black lab and he has a bit of a Bill Sentifiel.
So my first message for you.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that all of you think that the magic violence goes to women, which is a problem of women.
Not enough.
More than 75 percent of the microbes are men, and the medical space only happens in the same anti-stars, and so on a long day, and it said in the other way, the last place where we would want or to want to find a consequence of science.
I would have been said to be the last person in the world that would be with a man who would give it, and I actually went a very typical view because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 10 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be able to be visualized violence than the other age and more than 500 women, and over 500 women in the United States.
I also went up with a typical situation because I didn't know anything about the marine violence -- his sharks or his patterns.
I met I met I know I in a fire and the north night at night.
I was sitting on my side in the middle of New York City.
I told me two things.
The first one was that he was also trying to get out of a University of the English English and I was working in a very important room of Washington State.
But what most of the things about the first found is that it was ready and fun. And it looks like a girl of the car.
I had a lot of big molecules as a manufacturing, and a little bit of the bank -- and it seemed so surprise.
One of the most smart things that I did is, from the beginning of the beginning was to create the evidence that I was the forest of the particular computer.
He did it all on the beginning of the beginning to put in a penguin.
We started to go out and I found it all of me -- that was ready -- that I had been going to Harry, that I was able to help the techniques -- and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my influence, my dream and interventions.
I thought I created in me, as a woman and as a woman, as nobody had done it.
And that was why the relationship in that school and the work in Washington Studio and his future future had so much important for him.
I did not know that the first picture in any relationship of social violence is going to be serious and make the video.
And I don't know that the second step is to take it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was put back from New York and leave the work, but I thought he had to make care of your particular, so I said, I left my work and I went up and I went out of David.
I had no idea that I was going on in a little love -- that I was coming out of head in a physical protect, financial and physical physical chance.
The next step in the positive pattern of medical violence is to increase the violence of violence to see how it is.
And here is where they go on with those passengers.
When we moved at New Egyptians you know, that situation where I was supposed to know that I had to be so sure that I was bought three pieces.
One had on the color of the car.
Another one of them would put it down on the statement in our bed and the third always in your own police.
And he said that I needed those teachers to the water that I live of a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe for you.
But those pictures actually were a message for me and even though I had never left my hand -- my life was already going to be happy -- every minute of every day.
The first physical area of Congo happened five days before our battle.
They were at seven in the morning, and I still have the street.
five days later, when I was 10 models of my room had been described -- I put up my mother of my mother and my mother with him.
And even though I had happened. I was sure we would be able to be able to be able to be able to go up, because I was talking and he also wanted me to me.
And I was very, very sure.
It was simply been very excited by the battle and for the fact that I would form a family with me.
I had been a close access and I never had to have a day.
I spent two times more in our mind.
And the first time I was driving up to a red plant, and I lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I have a lot of times against the car of the car.
And then a couple of days later, moving back back from our mission of the ice of our mission -- and I would give me a Brazil Mars in the face of the face.
And I know I was able to put up one or two times per week for the next two and a half years of our marketing.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is value of dark violence or access at some point of their life, and the center of the University of the context of the context that every year every year of every year is married, 15 million people.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back back to my question: Why do I do?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was going out of me.
At the way, I was a very strong woman who was a very strong man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help me go back to the drugs.
The other question that everybody else does is, why does not just get me."
Why don't I get to me, I could have been at any moment.
So for me this is the most sad question and pain that people do people, because we know, we know something that you can notice -- it's incredibly dangerous to go to a microscope.
Because the last map in the case of traditional violence is kill it.
More than 70 percent of the states in the cases of the doctors are going to happen after the vision has put the relationship after the record, because then the state has no thing to do.
So others including the perfect action -- even after the apple has come back to help -- design of financial resources.
And we still continue to ask why you just don't get it?
I was able to go out of one last discovery that I came up with my business.
I realized that the man who loved so much -- I would have been made if he had been allowed it.
And so I break the site.
I told him all the world to the world, to my neighbors, to my friends, to my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you.
We have the tend to support the science as scale schools, women and statements down.
The question, "Why do you do?
For some people is a way to say, "The climate is the speed of the stream -- as if we were going to be able to find out of men who want to be able to build them.
But since I put "The "Line Link, I've heard of stories of men and women who were able to have a sense of what they were going to do is that they were going to have been able to be able to go and happiness and happiness and happiness and happy.
Because it turns out that I actually am a violence and a surface of a very typical education.
I was going to close with a red man and you have those three children.
I have that black black and as well.
What I'm not going to have to have to have even more, back, is a paradigm picture to my head in hands of someone who says I want.
At this time, they are thinking about it, "Height, that's fast, or "Hollywood, what do you have to say, but all this time I have been talking about you.
I'm sure there are a few people that are just listening to me right now, who are being material or that they were a little bit of small or that they are used themselves.
The value could be affect to his son, to his sister -- to your best friend right now.
I was able to put the end of my particular love.
And I keep doing it today.
It is my way to help other violence, and it is my last forest to you.
I talk about what you've heard here.
The property is just in the side.
They have the power to be able to be able to be able to just be able to just build light on it.
We need them all over the world.
We need each one of you to understand the secret of the American violence in the other.
You can get the magic to the light talking about it with their children, their work, their friends and family.
They represent his view of the surface as a fantastic people and standards, who have a future.
They get the very early few years of violence in order to try to be able to go out and show the visions a safe situation.
So many of us can become our fields, our mountains and our families in the sound of the sounds and scientists that should be be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Mars Robert, and for a time, I'm a model.
To be price for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this time there is a moment in the room because it should not be seen like this.  And by the way, I've been trying to change to change.
This is the first change for a TED, so you have a lot of surprise to think about it, I think.
If a few of the women are holding up when you go up, they don't have to do it right now, but it will just find it later in Twitter at Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter at Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter at Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter in Twitter there.
I also want to feel that I have the privilege of power to change what they think about in just 10 seconds.
Not all the world has that condition.
And these guys are very excited -- less bad.
The worst part is going to be able to go up with the head because it's when you're going to go back to me, so they don't do anything as I get the head of the head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been extraordinary.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The audience is power, but it also turns out.
I've changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a dream in real life.
And I was completely incredible and the photograph told me that I would add the space and I would hear the head of the kids.
Of course, I'm going to go up with heart or an architecture that I made me two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our think, which is, even though survival and institution, it has a great impact in our lives.
So today, for me to be a lot of mean to be honest.
I'm in this stage because I'm model.
Because I am a nice woman and white woman and in my market sector -- that's being a sexual girl in the time.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing me, but in the way.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a collective study, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made me model is because they put the genetic world, and I'm the benefit of a horrific, and maybe you're asking what this is.
Well, in the last century, we have not only developed the beauty as health as health and signal, which we are big programmed to address, also we have been associated to a high and a white skin and a white scale.
And that is my hospital -- I hope I have been able to take it to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now is a scale of school, and maybe there are a few feet of the movement that you say -- there are Japanese, Three, John States, Liberian States.
First of all, the happiness to know so much of models is amazing.
But I have to be able to give you that in 2007, a student of the University of New York City.
The next question that people are always doing is, could be model when you get more when?
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then, what would really tell each one of these children is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the invention of the next Internet or a national drug and poetry, which is a wonderful thing to be impossible, because you would be the first one.
If you after this particular list -- still inspired, no, no, I want to be money, then I say, I know my period.
Because I'm not at the middle of nothing -- and you could be the record of the record of the record comes up with the United States.
And to say that most of you want to be a model to say that you want to go up with the planet when you are bigger when they are greater when they are greater when they're bigger people.
It's out of your control -- it's amazing -- and it's not a work that you can choose to.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model -- because unlike the dark face -- it can be able to go up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
You know, once you have had your students -- and you have a culture and a few work to your spaces, no matter what they say, is to say, if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but your culture would look at the way for 10 years, people are going to look at it.
The next question that people always make me is if all of the pictures are released.
And you know, we basically get up all the pictures -- but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and it was also the first time I was going up with a biology, and I didn't even have my perspective.
I know that we are going into the personal perspective.
This is what it looks like.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came to me.
So here I am in a picture of a few days before the pictures for the pictures for the front Verman.
So here I am with my favorite team and in the back.
And this is me in the actor.
And I hope that they realize that I'm not me in those pictures here.
They are created from a professional group of primary, military phones, photographers, photographs and states, and all their help and protecting and protection, and they want to create this.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you have a big graph?
I have too much. I have a little bit about 20 more and I never use -- except the course -- but the principles that I'm going to have in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Carlish, and once I went to a story and I was going to take a money, and they gave me the grandmother to me.
When I was terrible, I went up with my friend who was a controlled park, he came up with a risk in red and, of course -- and it was a certain thing to be able to get out of control.
And I stopped out of these principles for my like, not for what I'm going to do, and there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the 1980s, the teachers that are going to give you and recognize, 80 percent of them were black and language, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 187 people and languages in New York -- so for them, it's not a matter of me to pay?
But how many times I'm going to stop me -- and when you were going to stop it?
When I was going to go for this talk to me, I found out that at 3D percent of 13 percent of the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that car is going to 37 percent to the 16 percent.
So the last question that people do is, how is the life of a model of a model of a model.
And I think the answer you would expect is, if you are a little bit more designed and you have the most brilliant film -- you will be very happy and strange.
And behind the cameras give a answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to talk to you, and also incredible people working with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what it happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I have never said about them.
And I am because I have to worry about my time every day.
And if you ever asked them, with a little bit more designed and the most beautiful head to be more happy?
They just have to come back with a group of models because they have the most destructive legs -- the most beautiful street and the way it is probably the most important women in the planet.
But about all of it was hard to get a sense of local support and money when I am one of the biggest bunch.
If there is something that comes from this talk -- I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image that we have from the success.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my idea since it was the most more enough to keep a camera -- but I want to share with you my 15 more profound pictures -- and I didn't go to me who did it.
There were no artists -- no strategies, no chance to reduce the pictures -- not even a kind of change in the limitation.
In fact, most of them would get them up to the lady.
My story started when I found in the New York in New York to give me a power, my wife took me this picture in my daughter in the day of her first computer day -- that's the college of 48 and 5.
He gave the ability to go back to New York in a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes now.
When he was the third computer of my son, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to San to New York in a parents and the relationship of the relationship?
This is when we started to ask the transportations that they were going to give us the picture.
It is amazing that the oil to get the camera to a whole way to be so universe.
No one has never noticed and actually never nobody has ever heard with the camera.
And so we were not aware of how much we will change this journey this journey out.
It became something sound for us.
This picture is from a few weeks after the 11 and I had to explain it to my daughter who had made that day so that a five years ago I could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a short moment or a specific journey of a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop the time in a single week and we can make them represent about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only physical level, but in all the sense.
Because even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes -- my daughter has been able to see the life through her eyes and how it looks like.
That time in concept that we spend together is something that we hope with all the year.
And really, in one of the robots -- we were walking on, when suddenly it comes up in terms and it will be a relevant red of the store of the store that I was able to have a little bit in the before.
And I found out what I had sense for five years of foot in that same place.
I began to remember his heart standing to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are interactive, because it's decided to study in New York.
And I suddenly understand that one of the most important things we create are the remember of it.
And so I want to share the idea of being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of.
I don't know about you, but it comes from these 15 pictures -- not just in many of the family.
I am always what the picture.
I want you to love them all to look at the picture, and they don't want to go to someone and ask them, "We have a photograph?
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The ones are getting in the most complicated grounds.
First of all, why do you have so bad it?
It has also been been associated with design the sense of meaning constructions as a metaphor characters, states.
And more recently, if you've been getting up the press big presentations, spaces and attention of these are the artists that are going on with the West Park, but it doesn't accept it.
I don't hear it. You know why.
Because the members of Park don't keep the environment --  -- they are not going to help you prevent the property of disease.
They are not going to be moving on.     And they're far out of staying.  And my favorite, the backs have better present.  There are two kinds of back in this planet.
There are the bombs in the New world who are actually found in the Americans, like the conditions and the careers and the Barries of the world -- where we have 18 species -- of these 16 -- 11 face a high risk of experts.
So, why are the ones are important. First of all, they make a little bit of living sensors -- Jesse.
These are our natural streams.
They call the data to the books.
They tend to kill all the bacteria -- help to support the clothes that will not be for them and cause great quality of general and diseases in other animals.
And recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no back, the cars took three to four times more time, and this has huge materials in the practice of disease.
The babies also have an enormous story.
They have been associated to the entire cultural culture.
And it was the system of the project and the material and, and together with the bottom, they were using the unit between the San and the English English.
In the United States, John was the black God -- and he took his life to save the God of 10 Harriet Santa.
In the right culture, they make a lot of very important theory in the open space, in places like the Terrible, there is no place to understand the death or the way to create them, so these people provide a system of nature.
What's the problem with the bottom?
We have eight species of back in Kenya, which six are in the very very very very very strange side of exception.
The reason is that they're being investing, and the reason that they are being involved is because there are conflict between humans and factory.
In the South of America, in countries like India and Pauling, four species of babies are in the critical area of extraordinary expensive, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is, and the reason is because it comes out with a statement like the Telescope.
This drug has been professional to use violence in India.
Because there is no bottom, there has been a practice in the number of beautiful boats in the numbers of deaths, and when you have a care dogs, you have a huge time of time for activity.
Kenya is going to have one of the most effective factors in Africa, 350,000 articles are going to be about the South line.
I'm not against the collective energy but we have to work with governments because the electric surfaces do this to the areas.
They are transportation transportation.
In the Western Africa, there is a terrible community of dead death to be able to be able to look at the button and the market.
So what is it? Well, we're going to make these areas. We are putting them.
We're trying to get their basic education, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so I'm going to focus in a real problem is not going to be able to look at all.
We have to work with governments in the religious level.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them to learn the bottom, about the need to learn these wonderful creatures and the services that they protect them.
How can you help it? It can be able to come up, and you can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very creative consequences -- giving up their time to spread the word to discovery.
When they come out of this room, you will be inspired by the baseballs, but they talk to their families -- with their kids, with their neighbors on the bottom.
They are very scale. Charles David said that he was able to be able to be able to be able to fly it out of surprise, without some energy in the sky.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I did and everything I do. My life has been married for seven years of work during my head in Africa.
Since 1998, until 1987 to 1987, but I don't know.  I worked in Bang, Kenya, Congo Construction and British and Balloid and Balaniam and Balaniam projects with African countries.
I worked for a NASA international, and every project that we were looking at in Africa.
And I was present.
I thought, at the age of the 20th, that we were going to be good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, everything we were able to do is we had the analysis.
Our first project, which inspired my first book -- "Any of the Brown, was a project where we decided to teach people from Zamage to change food.
And so we get with the state of the sun to the South Valley to this solved value that goes up to the Boston Book: And teach the local talents and the limits and the high streets, and so on.
And of course, people were not really interested in doing that, so we were able to come to work, and some times, they are not caused.  We were amazing that the local -- in so hard -- they had not had thank you.
However, instead of asking him how it was possible that it was possible -- we just said, "You know, thank God that we are here --  "I just have a time to save people in the human human?
And of course, everything in Africa.
We have these transition markets -- in Internet, a attention to this size -- in Zapan, this time.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the signs, read what is the fast artist?
When you take them out of the trees were bad and red and right in the night at night at the morning, about 200 hours they were able to come from the river and they went everything.  And we said to the signs: "God my talks?
And the changes said, "Yes, that's why we don't have a number here.  "Why didn't you say, "You never asked it.
I thought that only we were able to be able to be made in Africa, but then, I saw what the American Americans did -- what they were doing the English, and then I would see what they were doing, and then what they were doing -- I felt pretty proud of our project.
Because as you see, at least we feed we find the horrible.
You can see the designers --  You should see the descriptions that we gave them to the people in Africa.
I want to read a book, called "The Mars Mary Mary March, economic economist.
The book was published in 2010, in 2010,
In us, the Western countries, we have gone up to the African two billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the because that money has been done.
They just read your book.
And call it part of an African woman, the data we've done.
And the West we are exploring, the consumers are embarrassing, and we treat people just two ways or populations, or we are particularly.
The two words come from the local right right, which means "Chinese?
However, it means two different things.
Particle, I went to any of a different culture as if they were my children. I want to be a lot.
Particle, I took all of a different culture as if it was my seasons.
And so the white in Africa are call the Bangladesh, either.
And that book gave me a strange on the face -- "The little thing is beautiful: I wrote by School, who said about economic development -- if people don't want to be help help -- dance alone.
This should be the first piece of the help.
The first third of the aid is to be to answer it.
This morning, the guy who opened this conference on the ground and said, you know, you can imagine a city that is not nervous?
I decided at the age of 24 years just respond to people, and I invented a system called Facebook Force where you never started anything.
So what do you do? You get it.
They call a community with an idea, and it feels with the people in the local people.
We didn't work from the office.
We went on a chair. We found it in a car.
We have zero information.
And what do we do in friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion of it.
You can give you an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can have success.
The person with the idea can not have the knowledge -- but the knowledge is stayed.
So years and years later, I had this idea, why not us, for one time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why do we do that, for one time, we were going to do it -- but not in the common region.
I'll give you a research.
There is a problem with common research.
The entrepreneurs never saved, and they would say, in a public research, what you want to do with their own money, how opportunity they have evolved in.
So the plastic has this blind point.
In the most smart people in their community, you didn't even know them, because they don't get their public researchers.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on the face -- you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new professional again.
And the private is the family of the company, the family of the family of the business.
I started this as a test in hope.
I was doing a doctor at the time, trying to get away from this work that we have to tell them what to do.
And in one year, I had 24 projects in the story, and the government came to me to see to ask me, "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult to it.
And I heard to me and I heard it --  --  -- so the government says, "March again.  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
So we've helped to start to begin to be able to start to begin to it.
There is a new generation of empowers that are moving out of suburb.
Paul David, one of the most large articles of the story -- I was able to go back to 95, a few years ago.
Paul David was teacher before I was going to get in business in the business, and this is what Park Depense Dissens, "The plant is actually excited with a society and an inner economy.
The plastic is the bottom of the device of the entrepreneurial spirit.
So now you're going to be able to recognize Christian without knowing what the most amazing people in Charles want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to be able to build with you.
You have to give them to be able to give them up, private -- it has to be familiar when you help them, and then they will come back in the mass.
In a community of 10 people, we got 20 clinics.
You can imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and patient?
So what do you think of you have done more this morning.
You know, that's what you have used to.
So what I tell you is that the understanding is where it is.
We are at the end of the first international revolution -- the presentation of the resources not researchers, manipulation, and a moment to another time, we have systems that are not surprised.
And the whole thing is not surprising.
And you get them as a way of supporting food is not surprising.
And what we have to do, is how we can control, we come up, we ended up with seven billion people, in a certain way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for green revolution -- "The consequences? Right?
Government?
It will be the understand and they are doing it now.
There is an amazing story that is in a fundamental room doing many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to get the future of New York in the 19th York in the 1980s.
And in the age of 180,000 of them get this group of people -- and they used to be about what it would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the control was excited, the city of New York didn't exist in 100 years.
Why? Because they sent up the surface and you would get it, if the population is going to grow up to this rate -- to bring the population of New York to the areas, you will get six million gentlemen, and the strategy produced by six million pounds would be impossible to deal with it.
They were already going to be showing up in the street.  So in 1870, they were doing this technology that we were going to spend the time of New York.
So what does that happen? In the next 40 years, in the United States -- in the United States came up with 1,000 tons of the things -- 1950.
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely excited and there was very few -- factors in the street places.
Democracy, Michael.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be able to give them conflict up.
In the other way, I'm not going to see you with you.
Then you have to give you an absolutely one of us who have to be able to give them a standard service, excited.
And finally, you would have to tell you the truth with it to understand it.
The smaller company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things fast, the product that you want to see has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic concept, and you have to continue with a great statement statistically forest.
You know what?
We have been known to a single single human being in the world that can be able to do, sell and look at the money.
There is no exist.
This has not been born yet.
We have been research and looking at the 100 people in the College world, Web, Service, Alli, all the new companies -- Google, God.
There is one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common -- only one, no one was beginning for one person.
I was called the word I said, but the word "survive," 24 times.
He was not just when he said.
No one started a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have families -- who come from a little business of a little business sitting in a little bit of a little business.
What can you do you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it? Can you look for the money.
"Oh, no, I can't do that. I want you to look at someone to someone?
We act community.
Thank you.
You know, you can help us help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all networks, so we don't have a lot of knowledge despite the same public space.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neurons in the public space, with simple tools like shows, plants and titles.
And these projects are going to be like, how much would you pay my neighbors for her entirely?
How can we pay and ask more things to call the door in a bad moment.
How do you share more resources of our buildings being used and understand better our painter?
How do we make more of our hope to the care and our communities so that our communities can reduce today.
I was living in New bridges and I'm fortunate from New Yorkers.
My blood is always curious with the giant games that give you the same state and states and states from the end of the century.
It always gives the music.  There is a demonstration in New Arabics.  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest amount of properties in the United States.
I was living about this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more dangerous space for the back and also in something that changed my life for always life.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was John as a mother for me.
His death was incredibly and specifically.
I thought a lot in death and I thought about it.
And this would make me a lot of gravity for the time as well.
And he gave up the significant things of my life.
But let me have this look at this view in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it is easy to be able to take the day for the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the old help and new friends bring the wall of this house on a giant box and I asked him to be short to compassion, "And "I want to die.
So they could be able to take a task, remember about their lives.
I didn't know what to wait from this experiment but the next day, the wall was the wall and it was going on.
And I'd like to share some things that people write in the wall.
"I want to move out of the street for the way?   "I want to die to me in the line of face?
"I want to die to die for millions of people.
Before I want to die a robot?
So let me die out of the network?
"I want to move out of death -- I want to bring it back again.
"I want to die to the response of somebody else to go to somebody else.
"I want to die that I want to be completely myself.
And this space was used to be built and the dreams and hope of people and hope of people were going to be able to go to addition, and they gave me in a hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new and selective ways -- it is about to give the lesson to the rest and the control and to remember what the most important for us as we believe and change.
This was the last year and I started to get hundreds of messages of people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with that with my colleagues of the current center we did a billion, and now they've made women in countries around the world, like Harvard, South Africa, Africa, Argentina, and over there.
So many of us showed the power of our public space if you give us the opportunity to explain and share it out of it.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distribution in the time, it's more important than it -- finding the ways of creating the perspective.
The death is some of what we often take to talk about, or even thinking, but I understand that we will pay for the death is one of those things that make us more power.
thinking about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reduce better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share sports, fear and stories -- the people who can't only help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So today I have a single dangerous.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I would like to introduce you to my brothers now.
And I got 12 years old, it's high and very great.
I don't talk about it, but it turns out better than some of the best teachers.
You know what the love.
And so I would share it in which it happened what happens.
It's not an authority. I don't look at the color of the game.
You don't care about the religious differences and show in this, there was never me.
When you go out of our income -- I tried to make words that I didn't even tell me -- I remember one thing -- the little thing we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be done.
San has 18 years old. It's a very great.
It gets the most impossible memory of it.
And yet, it's a legal memory.
I don't remember if I came to me, but I remember the year when I came every one of the colleagues of my iPhone, connections that we did when I was four years old, to be able to put my arm in my arm for the first example of the Teams and the Four Park Park.
It doesn't seem to do it?
But most people are not again.
And in fact, because their minds are not going into the normal control of the society, often they are incredibly incredible and investing.
But what I put to my heart and the forest of my side was that even if that was the case, even though I was not going to consider them inside the ambition, that only could be able to mean one thing, which was extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those less families with the "Common Telescope, it is a brain free condition that affect social communication to the learning and sometimes to the physical ability to physical education.
And in every individual it gets a different way on the way that I remember is so different to San.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, it gets a new case, and even though it is one of the development of the technology that faster in the world, there is no cause in the world.
I don't remember my first one of my first one, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, I didn't seem very interested in me.
And I was living and I was born in his own world, with his own rules -- and I found out in the smaller things, as I put the car cars around the room, to look at the table and eat anything that would have between media and to eat anything that would have between the middle of media.
As I grew up, it becomes more different, and the differences were getting more elements.
But beyond the stars, the face and the intervention -- there was something really unique -- a national nature and intervention, a child who looked at the world without a presence, a human being ever a human that had never mind.
Extraordinary.
I can't realize that there have been some difficult moments in my family.
But I looked back back to the things that I've been taught about the individual -- the communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I didn't want to change for nature.
The nature happens to the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that someone is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could be able to transform one thing to record and San and you -- you don't have to be normal to be.
You can be extraordinary.
Because open or not, the differences that we have, are a headlesses? Every one of us has a day in the front of it, and the side of the normal is the last sense of the potential of the power.
The opportunity for the food, the program and the change of the time we try to be like the more.
Please don't tell me that I am normal for me.
Thank you.
five years ago, I experience a little bit of what it must have been already been alternative in the country.
He asked me to me to me, a piece of communication -- that I had a kind of communication to the engineering students to the environment.
I was standing.  And I was true of these students with these great students with his great minds and his big books and the big words and workers and workers and words.
But when you developed those conversation -- I felt what America had felt when I heard the water of the trust and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversation with the students -- I amazing the ideas that they have, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication of it.
We need a great communication of our scientists and interventions with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are taking our most big, big opportunities.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invited us to see their wonderful world.
And so scientists and engineers -- for the fact that we have a simple.
I want to share a little bit about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that their science is sexually sure that their environment is antiboration.
First question to say, and then what?
So let's give us why science is relevant for us.
We don't just tell us just that they study the transportation, but they study the motors, which are the wrong structure of our wife because it's important to understand and treat the protection.
And when you're finding their science, they care with the care.
The charge is a problem for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "specific and time, but why don't you say space and time that is much more access to us?
You can make it access not the same thing to make them together.
As America, as America, that everything is as simple as possible. But not simple.
They can communicate their science without understanding the ideas.
Some of them to think is to use examples and stories and analogy. They are ways to get up and engaged with their context.
And when you present your work, you come from the sea of the single season.
You have asked why they call the background of the background?  What do we do the balls -- and they kill their presentation.
A piece like this is not only a straight, but it is going to support too much in the area of our brain and are adapted.
In change, this film of example of George Brazil is much more effective -- shows that the special structure of the works is so strong that I really inspired the design of the New Legacy.
The third here is to use a simple fear, that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit -- and as a bit of profits that support our other sense, and they think a more deep sense of understanding of what it looks like.
I think these are just some key that you can help the others work the door and look at the country of the wonderful ones that is science and innovation.
And so, scientists and innovations, when you have been used to make this room, for all the media -- we have a simple.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the whole Darwin of the United States, is "Christian" is "Climbing?
It's just because it sounds very well.
And "Any "State means "Computer policy?
And there was a period of percentage of the 19th century that I mean much better when he said, "You know, a "Starve is that it would look for a public care without matter -- playing or first -- and that, when I had, you get it for the use of a great speed of a speed version of a speed version of a speed version of a speed version
I have no idea what it means is "speed?
Something that will do with the words, I came up.
It's very important that the words are the basis in political -- and that all politics know that they have to try to try to take the drive.
It was not until a 1880s, for example, 1984, I was allowed to be able to close the periodics to carry the extraordinary words that were told in the paradigm camera to be told in the paradigm camera.
And all of this was because of the view of a guy with the name of Brazil Brown, who went back to the particular.
They got them in the Toron of London and they would choose it, but he had the enough enough to go to them, and at the end of it had a popular support in London that they do.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the private protection of the printer and the battle like the methodology?
Most of them think that is literally light.
It's not. It's for a definition of the expert of expertise.
But to show you really how the words and the political policy -- I want to come back to the United States, right after the interaction.
So they had to be able to be able to take the question of how to call George Williams, his reading line.
They didn't know.
How do you call a country from a country coming?
This is a device for a long time.
They spent all kinds of responsibility that might have been providing.
Some of you want to call it "State "World Williams, and other Georges, and other Kenya William Williams, and other "Stocks of the United States.
It doesn't really get up.
Some of them just wanted to call it "Geophone."
They thought that it was a quality of reality.
And not even with it, they were common, they had the idea that one could be the idea that you could be recently recorded by a decline because of a decline plan.
And I could have been done.
The whole world will be increased, because this debate is produced for three weeks.
It was the data of a poor week, and I always wrote with this table?
And what causes the rest and the until I was that the Red Carter was against the Senator.
The camera of Republicans didn't want us to be able to power.
They didn't want to call it Real at the time that he gave him to him or his own ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most modern thing, more significant and more successful than they got them.
And that room was President?
Pressure. I didn't invest the title -- there was already before, but it just means somebody who would make a record?
It was like a control of a colleague.
And I didn't have a lot more great than the team "short or "State?
And there were some people who have been involved from small social and fundamental factors and the government of government, but it was really a very exciting thing.
And that's why the Senator was able to get up.
They said, it's directly, we can't call it President?
"This guy has to be able to go up and record with free faces."
And who is going to take a series with a lot of so straight and interesting as President of the United States.
And finally, after three weeks of decade, the second didn't come up.
We can learn three interesting things.
And first of all, and this is my family to where I've been able to find out, the second has never been able to find the principle of president.
The President Bang Bang is trying to go out there, waiting to the second between the Alaba.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is a technology --  -- you may be able to expect 12 years more.
But the third thing we can learn and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to leave you, is that the United States of the United States.
And over all if you have more than 100 nuclear cases, the largest economy in the world and a flow of the article arms and so on.
And the reality and history have led to the sort of great graph.
So at the end of the Senator.
They got their responsibility to it.
And as well as the other. The sound of seat, well, it was a show in the time.
But you know how many neurons have now present?
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the three nuclear causes and so on.
So, at the end of the Senator and the camera of responsibility would lose it, because nobody is going to feel humanity when they say that they are now the United States.
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn and that I would like to leave you.
The policy trying to choose and use the words to give it and control the reality -- but actually, the moral reality much more the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in a military mission of Ghana.
And the air is careful and public and it is hard to answer it.
I feel the surface of the blood bodies in the dark -- but I can't see a lot more.
I play voices that talk about, but about all of the top of those mass and parallel things with private tools with private tools.
As the others, I took a state of the subject of the subject of the head with this care and I can just give you the words that have the walls of that water of a month that has a hundred feet in the Earth.
And he turned out my hand and suddenly I remember a way I found days before, that I lost the control and heavy in that time.
And as I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole to look at their lives without pay and performing and often die.
I went out of that home and I went home, but they might never do it, because they are about the school.
In the last 24 years I was designing natural culture in more than 60 countries in six countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only expert in the Columbia of the Pole Country.
And among all the amazing people I met there I met in the "State of "The "States -- a North American that is going to reduce the modern school.
We started talking about the chain and really, I started to learn about school because I knew there was in the world but not at the world.
When we end up to talk to me very bad to me that I felt very bad.
And I was doing a neighbor and weeks later, I went to the Levels to meet the direction of "The Sande Steve -- and I will make my help.
So I started my journey to the modern scale.
There was already been in many of these sites.
In some ways, I was able to know my second home.
But this time, to visit the sounds out.
A building cell says that there are more than 24 million people in the world.
It is the day of the amount of Africa in front of the whole area of transformation school.
150 years ago, the cost of a high school was about about three times the authority of a United States.
The equivalent to about 50 percent.
But today, you can be able to be able to make family families by the devices of the 18th 1980s 1870s.
It turns out that the scale gets a few more than a few billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been related with bad effects of good education and better work for then to find out that they're willing to work without pay -- under violence of violence and you can't get out.
Today, the school is going on in the forest, the good problems have value -- but those people are struggling.
The scale there is in almost everybody in the world, and yet it's interesting around the world.
In India and New and I met the holes of the sidewalks.
This sort of strange and formula was just like to go to the ancient Earth or the International Deney.
Now I was in a 3D technique, men, women, women, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in a very short room of the password -- they were available by the head of their head, to 18 at the same time, and they take them out of the ants to the surgery that are hundreds of meters.
And so despite the monkey and the school work in school, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 18 hours a day.
There were no pieces to eat -- not to go up, and the description would have been going to be able to work out was pretty interesting.
And so they were the car and the model that my camera became too high to the cost and I stop to work.
Every 20 minutes I had to go back to the car to call the team and make it work with air completely to take it up, and sitting there, I thought, my camera has a much better treatment than these people.
And I wanted to get in the honor I wanted to read but the adult that was going to my side of me and he said, "You don't do it. You don't do it.
And I was very clearly that I'm going to show you a lot.
I couldn't be able to be able to give you a right.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I wasn't a city of that country.
I could put it in a better situation that they were already going to be.
I had to trust the Simple "The Silicon and working inside of the system for his light and I trust it to get it.
At the time I hope to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Michael, I found children who have been able to be able to pay for miles for a lot of monkeys until they would wait down.
Those big plants were more based than the children who carry them and the children who are going to get them to their head with the careers made of pathogens, care and dragons and drivers.
It's hard to think about something so observation.
How can we invest in something so infinite -- but they are so infected?
Some of you don't even know that they are scales -- and they work 16 or 18 hours a day without pay -- because this has been like this.
They have nothing with what to compare it.
And when these leaders came up with their literature, the schools were running up their home.
When you hear the word word we often think about sexual treatment and because of this global awareness I would be hard to be difficult for me to work in this particular business.
In Daniel told me women who had been incredibly similar similarity.
They came up with a couple of anti-stars that they were going to have to come to this sound -- to take up light light.
It wasn't exactly a blood.
It was more well a resource.
Recently, as you know in the office -- they are local for the factory forest.
They have small windows, presentations, where you have the scales with their children and children -- some of them just seven years old, they are forced to train the colleagues and to help you buy more food.
Each of them is dark and soldier, identify by a picture on the wall.
The workers often make sex search to hands of their chairs.
And in the middle of the breast, I remember to have been a strange tower and at that sense, you can never imagine what it should be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I just had a side, the schools for where it is.
There was no good people.
There was no enough enough enough as you can deal.
Those people do not have a school and because we took a very difficult issue -- it's important to be able to be able to be able to be able to be successful to be seriously, including the sexual traffic to us.
There are hundreds of people who are used in architecture -- in resources, in the sexual service and the list can continue it.
Remember, the New York City.
It goes up to go up, but we don't see it.
The sizes are another activity that often we often relationship with the hand.
I came up with the Indian limits in which there were families on the food of the side.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father -- the therapist of blue and suddenly of their children.
It takes them together in these big bees and dead in the speed up to each other, but the rate is extraordinary to each other.
I was interested to me with his story.
We don't have a literature, they said.
It is not going on, yet we could come out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job to us.
It was just that there are more than 400 children in the Virginia Langla, the biggest artificial chair in the world.
When we came back, I was going to take a quick thing.
I saw what it looks like to be a family family in a boat -- two weeks later, some more young children -- it has sense right?
They were all scale.
The children are surprised of their favorite families and described and started to work.
This child has eight years old.
When our boat was able to be able to be able to see that his little context was straight.
I was involved by the fear of the water.
And the real traditional of the local trees in the Valley Valley is often looking at networks and children and families, and with fear -- they get back to the water to develop the rooms.
And so many of them would get up.
Since I remember, it has always been forced to work on the date.
On the way it is not going to get out and as all of the life has been treated with consciousness, it is certainly about the most young schools under their world.
I met these guys to the five in the morning, when they were going up with the last networks -- but they had been working from the one one one of a one one of the last one.
On the last night and the virus.
And you have to be able to find out that these networks are more than 400 miles when they are starting to fish them.
I want to introduce you.
Kenya was turned out in a flu army.
I met it in a decision that "I was going to "the "The States of the subjects of the school.
King would be able to be possible.
Who will get to be thank you for someone decided to make the difference in your life?
And I went up for a career in Ghana with the Singapore of the Singapore -- a adult company with his kind of analysis and survived our car and survived the surface.
And I asked us to do it by a way of land to the season.
At the end of the way, I tried to go out of the car, and he asked him to the concept that was going to happen.
And then I'm going to be a very vision and he said, "This is the path -- this is the way.
And as we started to go down, we took the ideas that were looking at the way and after walking about a time we found that the way was addressed by the rest of the laws, so I put the group of pictures about my head as we get in these water to the bomb.
After two hours of it, the next way was able to end up in a car, and we had a mass of holes that I could head in a field of fire, and all of them were full of scale workers.
A lot of women had the children because of their spaces and while they were looking at order, they were going on in water with marketing with media.
The market is used in the process.
These minutes are used in a piece in a picture in the other.
When they came out of the time they were exploring in their own way.
I remember to look at his eyes carefully, income, because many of them had been under land for seven hours.
The people are going down to 90 meters and these people are going to make back balls of fear that then will be transformed to another area where they will take the fear so that you can explore the order.
First of all, the site seems to be full and straight men -- but if we look at more than close to the markets we see to work to each other, and also children.
All of these things are visible views, disease and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be very likely that this machine ended up like this view of the landscapes and the market in a few years.
This is Mars. When he died his father his father took him to work with him in my mind.
When I die to the top, Mary would look at the oil of what it was going to be scale in the hands.
When I met it, I had worked in the middle 14 and the freedom of the legs that you see here is a product of an activity in the world, so much that the doctors said that they should be a care.
And as well as it comes up with it, David has to get all of it, and it is not about that, it's willing to work night and day at that way.
Even like that, he went up with being limited and developed with the clothing of local artists like "Army and this kind of definition, and it's this kind of definition, to help a real possibility -- what I really inspired a lot of answer.
I want to bring light on school.
They knew their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be able to be able to be able to do it and do everything possible to help change their lives.
I don't think if we can see each other to other as human beings -- then it makes a very difficult to be able to be able to be able to be transformed as the school.
These images are not recording them. They are from people, real people, like you and like me, who are getting the same rights and discussion in their lives.
There is no day that I know that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, which I've had the big honor to know about.
I hope that these images are going to take a force in who you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force is going to make a force and that fire growing light on the school because, without that light, the service of school can continue to live in the surfaces.
Thank you very much.
And I make a profile problem and there's a perfect problem for who do it -- we are like the supermarket controls.
Nobody knows what we do.
So today I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most humans.
It gives us the version of the bank and the limitation of the top   we will see more of them.
But the plant is a bunch of extraordinary training -- a high level of designer, and probably really certain anti-profit act that you can have a genetic computer.
It was now, the neurons like the wrong of Palestinians are going up with this extraordinary ability -- as it does with my friend John Sunday, that in his time, it was a vision of balloon.
In the last few years, it has become a lot in the treatment of it.
However, there are six million people in the world that are designed and they have to deal with a small design, terrorists, and other senses of this disease -- so we need objects to stop the disease before it is too much.
We need to measure the progress in the way, and in fact, the only way that we know if there is actually a way to be when we have a moral motion and the third thing.
But it is shown that for Paris and other terms of the movement there is no biological blocks -- so they don't know the blood attention and the best thing that we have is a bit of 200 minutes.
You have to go to a clinical to do it. It's very, very cost -- and that means that, outside the clinical trials -- never do.
And what if the patients could do in home.
And that will save a difficult journey to the clinical -- what if the patients could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this?
You don't need personal people.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the nervous clinical level.
And so what I want to show you as a way that I want to try to try to try it, you see, in a certain sense, we are all seen as my friend John South South.
This is a video of the vision of the visual records.
It shows somebody as a sound as I have been able to talk about it, and we can imagine how a little bit of a video ball because we have to control all these local organs to produce sounds and all of us all have the genes -- for example.
And as the ball, it requires a whole level of extraordinary analyze.
We think about the time that leads to a child to help me.
So from the sound of the sound -- we can make the position of the real relationships as they came in, and like the Parkinson's protecting the expensive, as well.
In the bottom you can see an example.
We see the same sounds.
Videollage view, discovery and red.
The design becomes more likely and analyzed after a car, and this is an example of the systems.
How do they share these simple sites in the voice with the specialists of the specialists -- well, they are not investigating.
The neurons is not infected. They are both used to use the existence there.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospital to do it.
And both of them are price -- OK, but as well as the eyes in voice are not space.
I mean, you can be additional.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
And they are in the bottom and we all know what happens to happen.
When something gets a cost so low -- it comes to the space of space.
These are a few amazing memories to address it.
We can reduce the language diagrams of patients.
I would not make a little bit to go to the collective control.
It was in the top of the high factory we could get the data.
We could be able to make a little bit of very low cost for the clinical trial and for the first time, and for the first time.
We have the opportunity to start to look for the first beauty of the disease before it is too later.
And so when I give you the first step in that sense, we're taking the North English English.
And I was going to Taliban and Republicans, we want to get a lot of voices all over the world to take enough data and start to deal with these objects.
We have local lights for about 75 million people in the world.
Anyway, with or without Paris, you can call it in the beginning of the price and let me go up for a control -- and I was able to figure out that we already have seven percent of the table in only eight years.
Thank you.   Richard Robert, and so forth.
What do you get out of these shows?
Michael Liberia, yes, yeah, what happens is that during the call you have to figure out if you have or not the disease.
MT: You know, some people can not spend it. You may not get it.
But we are going to get a very large thing to get a lot of different data in different controls, and do it in different creatures is important because we're looking at the financial factors in the face of the disease of disease.
PM: Do you have 80 percent of pressure in this moment.
MT: A lot more than that.
In fact, my school Time, I have to change it, has done a fantastic work, and now has been shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well. Now we have a percent. Now we have a percent.
MT: I knew and note. Well, it's a better.
MT: Of course.
CA: Thank you very much. Mary Line, public East.
MT: Thank you, Talk.
Before I looked at the 1990s I made pictures in New York City.
We are pretty much performance, grandmothers.
We're going to take us in the dark -- in many without viruses, and by the way, we put the solar challenge.
We are doing the democracy models even more discovery, the perfect skin still more perfect we do the impossible -- possible and they grow us on the question all the time, but some of us are really artists with so many years of experience with a lot of experience and the picture.
The 11 percent of 1950s, I came from my house, as the rest of the world, the rest of the world that happened in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan at all.
I mean, a little time later, an organization where it was visible, and there are Hawkin Valley, I was in the place working as part of the answer.
I know, with hundreds of other violence we knew that we couldn't make them sitting in home, so I decided to go into the group for three weeks.
The 13 percent of them came to the Alice.
It is a little bit of particular fish in the present of Simplant for almost 50 people, one of the first people are affected by the ocean.
The water level of water.
As you can imagine, the people was dead.
And we just get out of the streets and the heads.
We call schools -- we take the side and we leave the side to be relevant and record.
So we were going to take tons and tons of financial food.
And we were excited to us and we love it.
For weeks, so much of them as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and thousands and lots of pictures and cameras and heads.
They all did the same thing.
They get them back and bring them to different places from all around the people to get it.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures would have been a huge part of the personal people that those people had survived.
As you go out of the room, and to save their lives, they had to get absolutely all they have.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a control center of the people.
It helps to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the huge bacteria to the enormous baseballs.
This place turns out to be the place of the village where the center of the education red the pictures together.
And I was going to take them up and I had the honor that that day they will trust in me to be able to get the pictures to you.
This was amazing and inspired -- I had heard the experiment to think beyond the hours, but it was not until I was going to keep myself myself that something happened.
When you look at the pictures -- I found some of you who had more than a hundred years of a few years were still in the lab of the lab -- I couldn't avoid to think about how to fix that detail and to get hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night went in Facebook with some of them, and at the next morning the answer was so open and particular, I knew that we had to try it.
So we started to reduce the picture.
This was the first of all.
It was not too much, but where the water had been developed the face of the child I had to get up with a lot of pressure and developed.
In the other way, that guy would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as typical as to have the photograph of it.
With the time of time, they came up by the more pictures and they had more relationships and they need more release to be in Facebook and Lincoln and five days later, 20 days of 12 countries.
At two weeks I was 150 weeks of dead.
In Japan in Japan, we moved to Revolution, a picture at the North Bang.
Once a week we used to be used to be able to be able to be in the technology in the drugs that have gone in, where people were going to take their picture.
The time that they were going to be able to do is a different story -- it depends of the hope of the pictures of the picture.
I could imagine a hour. I could be able to make weeks out.
I could make months.
This guy had to be able to draw in the hand using the areas whose color and detecting the water had no designer.
I took a long time.
And the water did all of these pictures surrounded in the side of the side, which is completely straight, even with access, all of the time with the past of the time I could be able to be able to be an important part of the project.
We can't show the picture at least that it was clearly, and I would have been responsible for his day.
We had it with the classroom by hand.
We heard with the water of a record self.
It's very easy to give even more the pictures that are already given the picture.
As he said once once once said, the leader of my group is how to make a steel.
You can't be able to make extraordinary.
The woman who brought us up these pictures that are going to be able to do the picture.
I had started to call them she but he goes back to realize that I did it even more.
I also had discovery.
However, the images of your wife and their own face would not have been able to be able to reduce the images in a single picture and reduce the whole picture.
When I got his pictures shared some of his story with us.
So a few of their husband found the pictures in a station in the workers that are very far from where it used to be their house, but their colleagues will get them to it.
The day in the transport, his market was the fact that the boat of the soldiers.
It had to go into the water while the services were wrong.
Your little kids, not so small now, but their two children were in the color, in different ways.
And one of them was standing in the water.
And I took a week to find all his family and know that they had all come out.
The day that I put up his pictures his son in the top 15 years.
And for it, despite all of this, those pictures were the best reason I could do it, something that he could come to looking at -- something that I could remember from the past that I had not been killed by that day when everything in his life changed or was fun.
After six months in Japan 150 tons had been used in there with a hundred hundred of them helped us to change more than a lot more than 150 pictures -- the vast majority -- the great majority of their days.
More than 500 values around the world helped us to go back to 90 family hundreds of pictures of pictures and release.
For this time, we really don't spend more than 100 in team and materials -- most of them in the top for impressions.
We take a picture of construction.
A picture is a remember of someone or something -- a relationship -- some of the ways.
They are gravity of our resources and stories -- the last thing that we would take to us but the first thing we will go back to it.
And this was what the project was trying to do is that I was trying to make small pieces of humanity of humanity -- to give someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is coming back to somebody like this, it was a huge difference in the life of the person who stops.
This project also took a great difference in the life of records.
A few of them connected them to something bigger -- save something, using their attention for something that are not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be pretty much perfect.
In order to find out I would like to read this research control, I was sent by the day I came from Japan after six months.
And as I came up, I couldn't be able to think about people and stories showed in the images.
One of a particular one, a picture with women in different age, from the grandmother to the little girl to the small girl -- I was able to a baby of a baby to me, because a similar picture of my family -- my mother -- my mother and my mother, and my mother came out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all of our basic needs are the same thing, right?
Thank you.
He gave us English involved to us and quality with this picture of a ball that takes a paradigm in a sign of just a billion of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion dollars per second.
So I present a new kind of photograph -- the factory, a new language that can create video video in the movement of the light.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see in the top of the lives, beyond the living line or to see the inside of the body without using X-ray bottles, and they find really the idea.
If you take a look at it, and I read it and put it into a second of second or it is, in a number of oil to create a picture of a picture of a single single single single single year.
And that piece of photos -- that base, to go to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common room than a common language.
If you take that base and this picture of photo and we have a lot of pictures and we're going to have this battery, how do you get those people inside this boat?
What is the aspect of the light in a classroom?
Now, all of this --  -- you remember that all of this happens in less than a second is what it takes to travel the light of the light.
But this video is 10 billion times later so you can see the light in movement.
Competition doesn't use this research --  -- so many things in this film -- to give you this information to show what is going on.
The piece, our balloon, in the bottom with a pattern of pictures that starts to come into it, and that in the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of it.
This is part of the light -- it goes to the table, and we started to see these ants.
A lot of the pictures are finally coming up to the train, and then they go into a few direction.
As you can see, there's a ball of air that goes on in the inside of it.
And in that time, the waters travel on the table and because of the rest of the surface that you see in the bottom of the baby, after a number of themes -- that the lights are going to get up.
Now, if you take a common basis and the right and we make the same day, and we see it in camera to about 10 billion times, how many of you think that we would make us feel that physically?
One day. A week. Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very dark film --  -- of a beautiful language in movement.
And what would we try to do with nature diagnostic?
You can see the areas that they get out of the weight and the wall and the wall of the forest.
It's just like to open a piece in a street.
This is the way that nature has a picture -- I thought, from a foundation at the time, but of course, our eyes are looking at a very amazing computer.
But if you look at one more time, you will realize that as the light is able to come out of the size -- it is not surprised.
Why? Because the size is motivated and the brain light in its inside and come back back back of several billion second.
In the future, when this focus is in their mobile molecules, they will be able to go to the surface and see if the Africa is killed without having to touch it.
So what do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photograph -- you know, if we take a picture in the end of extraction, it was very little light.
But we're going to create a billion times faster than the most expensive existence that will just come into a light of light.
We set up that room, that period of people, millions of times, and we got over and over again with a very strong room, we took those galaxies of data and we put them out of the data to create those pictures I showed you.
We can take all of those data in order and process in an interesting way.
It can be able to fly up.
Other humans can come in.
And if a new power of a future future would let you see after the Americans?
The idea is that we could take some light on the door -- Remote, going into the room, a part of this is going to focus on the door, and from the camera to the camera to the camera to the camera to the camera.
Where we could make those massive relationships of light.
This is not science science -- we've built it.
On the left is our family.
In the wall there is a man and we will take the light on the door in the country.
After the police of our article in New Community.
And a small sense of the pictures will go to the camera but right now, at the time there are very different moments at all.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our family, it has only unique ability to.
It's very good enough and it can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the distributions to the door and also to the horse objects but we don't know what it is to point out what it works.
When you project a brain you can get a picture of the back, that you see in the screen -- you don't really have any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, tens of images -- we will get them and try and try to save the bad robots of light, and with that, we can see the object object?
So we can see it at 3D.
This is our research.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going on with what it is on the course of the career.
Or we could be able to look at the dark conditions looking at the light on the open senses.
Or we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at the inside of the body and the same thing for the cores.
But of course, because of the tissue and the subject that is quite difficult -- so this is actually a asked to the scientists so that they started thinking about the photograph as a new model of view to solve the problems of the image in the next generation of the next generation of the next generation.
This is how I did San Marin, he said a scientist -- it would make the science in art -- an art of fantastic pictures an art of fantastic.
I realized that all of the groups of data that we remember are not just for scientific violence, but we can be able to be able to be scientists but we can just be able to be able to be scientific visions.
They create a new way of computer picture with camera and code of colors and color of colors and code of colleagues and color together.
And we look at those contents. They remember, the time between each of those workers is just a few billion second.
But here is also some fun.
If you look at the wars under the transport, these are a lot of us.
The waters should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are getting almost about the speed of light, we have strange effects -- I would have love to see this picture.
The order that is going on in the world sometimes in the world sometimes in the world.
And I was able to be able to be able to control space and time, we can take this distribution.
It's time. Thank you.
Here. This is my mobile phone.
A molecule can change life, and you give them individual fun.
And with a machine can be able to make a crisis against the humanity in Service.
With a molecule you can take a message and put a project in Europe.
With a molecule you can be able to be able to get a career, and I would get it out and make a lot.
All of this is possible.
I am a Chinese Chinese and I live in the city.
Let's go back to that moment, this city.
And here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is the other one of 19th -- imagine if all these people who are going to protect on a change of a change, they had a phone in the ball.
What are you going to have a molecule here?
Let me take you.
You read your mobile thousands of them.
Let me give you a Street, a Barry, what was a Bangaras.
It's a lot. It's almost all of you today.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my molecule and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 36-year-old lines of information.
data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2009, the College of the United States, a direction.
The December of data.
This device says that every single power company says that every single transition of the whole Internet of the whole Europe, you have to make a sort of argument from the use of users.
Who called what I was going to get to you.
Who has a text to you.
And if we use the molecule where we are.
And all of this information is killed by at least six months, and up to two years, in your phone company or its Internet.
And in the whole Europe people would put up and said, "We don't want this.
They said that they didn't want to want this data.
We want the authority in the digital and we don't want the phones and the Internet protections of the Internet to make this whole information about us.
There were standards, stress, survivals, everybody said, "We don't want this?
And here you can see a few thousand people who came to the streets of Britain and they said, "Oh, don't the man."
And some of you even said this would be the State 2.
And the State was the U.S. Paris in the Middle Africa.
And I also asked me if this works.
Can you support all this information about us?
Every time you use the mobile molecule?
So I asked my phone to my phone -- Deney's Telescope, which was the largest phone company of Arabia, which for the fact that I was going to send me all the information that they have about me.
I asked them once one time, and I was going to ask them, and I didn't get a control response -- it was all white -- blood.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are putting my life.
And so I decided to put it up with a global design because I wanted to have this information.
But Replay London said no, we're not going to give you this information.
And at the end we were able to go up in the end.
And I was going to go up and they would send me the information that I would do.
And as you know, the World Congo Colorado was able to make it the freedom for the lab of the Dead record.
And so I got this fish on manufacturing with a CO2 inside a CO2.
And in CO2 there was this.
This is three and five thousand dollars an information.
At the beginning I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge adult adult.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this architect.
It was a little specifically, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am like, where I am doing the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it Audience: I want to do it.
Because I want to show you the people what the attention of data.
And so I went to Germany And October David Carol, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can get up and followed and go back and go back and attention.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go out of Francisco to Colomo, and what I think I can call in the transport.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called me a couple of times.
And then I call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this great network of communication here.
You can see how their people will communicate each other to what you have called each other to each other.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who I talk to who -- who makes you a machine to that, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information goes up at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, you imagine if all these people in the streets of Beaut, in the face of 100 -- they had a phone in the pain.
And the state had been known who seemed in this protection, and if the State had known who the leaders were -- this never had happened.
And the West of Berlin may never have happened.
And in aware -- I don't have the early of the Chinese Country.
Because now in the side of the statistics and companies want to take a lot of information of us as possible as possible as it possible.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be able to take them up for it.
But the application and live in the digital was not a control.
But now you have to fight the automobile.
You have to fight that's a day.
When you go home at home to his friends that private is a value of the 21st century, and it's not going on.
When they go home, I'll give you to your responsibility that only because the companies and the solar intelligence can be able to make a certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask her to her phone company, what information will do of you.
So in the future, every time you use their molecules that would be to remember that they have to fight the terrorist in the digital world.
Thank you.
Hello DNA, what happened?
It's not enough.
Hide DNA, what happened?
And I called me Mars "Mars and I'm not a dark, but I know the doctors I brought into the world.
I went back to my mother six times in six different direction.
And as a result, I have a brain particle, so I have the time all the time.
Look at it.
It's a stranger. I'm like a School man.
And Dr. All.
Dr. China.
It's not control or it can tell you.
No one made my mother out of my mother and I didn't know it because my parents were passionate beautiful, although they are.
It just happens for access -- like I was going to get out of it.
Now, I'm going to take you, I am not a sense of institutions -- and I don't want it to be not about the present of the pressure of them.
It feels wrong for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be discovery.
Let's go out of it.
And I was surrounded from National, are in the commercial center -- they are going to control in the ball of strategic and what do you see.
And 15 places for the control.
And they think, "You know, I can be at least a little bit of distance."
And also, I tell you, I say, I have 14 problems -- and Dr.
There is a complexity of the presentation, I would make the market market.
I am healthy, machine, woman and lived in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Paris Charles, in New Jewish.
I always love that my back and my disease.
I also love that if I wanted to walk out of my house to New York, I could be.
A lot of people with brain particles don't walk up, but my parents don't believe in the can't be able to think about it.
The center of my father was, "You can be able to do it.
If my three hours they were going on, I was called a standard.
If my three hours were going to the public school, my parents gave the school system, and they realized that I was also, and if we don't get all of the side of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years I put my talks in his feet and just walking on.
Another thing that I used was to have a dollar in front of me so that I did it.
The surprise I took inside was very strong and so on.
Yeah, the first day in the front of an infinite day was walking as a field of biomass that has got a lot of galaxies.
At the way, there were only six days in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Roberts, and they are still all of the family.  I think nobody is realized that we were not an ancestor.
This was before 18 and that politics would be able to use "The "little "Mandela to the machines as a campaign.
The people I grew up had no problems with my faith with me.
It doesn't seem to worry about a lot that I would die of hand during the rain.
I was told to tell them that I had enough enough to live three months without the eat -- so I'm going to end up in the face of the record is very easy.
And he was taken in Brazil.
Yes, in Brazil. It's crazy --  My parents couldn't pay the physical third -- so they were going to the medical school.
I learned to walk with careers, or I can walk with careers.
I am from New Jesses, and there we want to be a girl, so if my friends were using tapirs, I too.
And when my friends were going to go through the version of version in the cost of Jerusalem, I was not.
I was going to be able to go in a war of war, because my parents take that if we didn't go back to Palestines all the green -- we become Mars.
In the surface of the surface I was trying to get up, so I was working out of the way, and I was put up on the space of the parent, I would put up in the Mars Martin, and I remember that the water worked my eyes and I thought, "I work?
But the military culture was the play.
I have to say that it's very expensive -- but before I do it was a stage that I could not be able to put out of the piece of particular.
And now I can sound in the head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything that no dream was impossible -- and my dream was to be in the Holiday Hollywood.
I went to the quality of the positive discussion and he got a ball for the United States, University of the state of America, because I was going in all the coasts.
It was like the market love of the street street.
They all loved me.
I made all of the rate of the less smart -- I had the life in my class.
Every time I was doing a stage of the control of the control of the control of my professionals.
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the U.S. decided to do a job called Bank Balloa in Japanese.
This is a work of a girl with brain particles.
I was a girl with the brain paradigm.
And so I started to feed to the four videos: "The end will have a paper.
I have brain pains.
At the end of the book?
Thank God to God, at the end of the end of a book?
I don't get the paper.  They gave it to Steven Brazil.
I was going to figure out how to go back to the distance of the decade, which was starting to be done as if someone had killed my car, and she said to me why and she said to me that because they believe that I could not do the sounds of risk students.
And I said, "Well, if I can't do the stars of risk -- you can also do the child?
It was a paper for which I had literally been born and they gave it to a back without paralyzed breast.
The college was taking my life.
Hello has a story of able to be able to be able to be able to be able to add access for discoveries of discovery.
When I was going back, I came home, and my first critical art was as a strange in a terrorist.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be a "State of "Line to "Brown friend of the side of a site.
In change, I was there as a garden, I was not going to see me more than the nation -- and it was an old thing for me that the record directions were not going to build some grandmothers -- not white and with design.
They just made perfect people.
But there were experts to the rule of it.
I grew up looking at Gandhi George, Robert Ben, China, and all these women had one thing in college: they were discovery.
That's why I made a manufacturing.
And in my first he took the famous communities in New York at New York to New York, and I never forget the face of the first case I took when I was going to go back in the fact that I was going to high school for a control that had a brain.
I was working on the United States, and also in Robert in the Middle Anderson, or without a virus.
Some people say that I am the first seat of the world.
I never like to remember the first place, but I know that they never heard that little death death that says women are not fun.
In 2007, my brother of another mother and father -- David Law, and I was looking at the September of the New York, now in his 10 York -- in his 10,000 year.
Our goal was to change the normal image of the Americans in the media of communication and at the time that we will remember the details of responsibility that survival and Robert are not yet.
It was a lot more easy to be much more easy than I fight the challenge of the state of the discovery.
So my great opportunity came in in 2010.
I was like invited to the news of news.
And I was like it was to a death day, I went back to a study and sat on a study and sat on a single day.
And I looked at the direction and I said, "Well, you can give me another single single single single one.
She looked at me and he said, "Man: three, three, two, two, two.
And we were in life.
So I would add to the write of the beginning to not come out of the screen during the secret, and when I ended up the intervention, I was positive.
At the end I had my opportunity and developed. I knew they would not come to invest.
But not only Dr. Benjamin went to invest, but he was like a particular time and I put my side.
Something fun that I learned in direct with George Bangladesh was that people in the Internet are expectancy.
It says that children are constructed, but they never come out of me or a little girl or a little bit of it.
All of a sudden, my device in the Internet became a location.
So I look at the colleagues on the way I said, "Why do you mean?
Is it short?
And my face, "The terrorist green professor."
What does it mean?
We really should take it through it.
A financial start was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get my control to my colleague, and purpose, profitable.
The distribution is as visual as the right.
If someone on the grandmothers can't do Big, then Benjamin can't make someone in the single signal.
The discoveries are the day, yes, they hear it.
We are the most large largest of the world, and the most results in the world.
The doctors said that I would not work, but I'm here in front of you.
However, there would be grew up with the media of communication -- I don't think I was going to be.
And I hope that together we can create more positive images of the distribution in the media and in life life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that will make less obvious in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our kids.
My journey has taken me to very specific places.
I was going to walk by the red forest for the decade of the States Steve and the Law Land Rosetta.
I came to act on a film with Alice San and to work with my day, the incredible David Mars.
And I would remember the world to go up with the robots have become little limits?
I went back on the rest of the great state of New Jewish state in the Country of 2010, 2011,
And I said, "The children of Mars, an organization organization to give kids a little bit of what my parents gave me to me.
It was the only time my father was going to be able to act in life, and he gave him this talk to his memory to his memory here.
(Audience: And you know, in peace ...
I'm called Mars Germany, and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little girl of a small place.
I don't know his name but I know his story.
It lives in a small village to the South of Santa.
This people is near Mars.
And the seat is a little bit.
No one for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, Mars, the Sun campaign.
When I got there, there is no opportunities -- there is no work, or a future.
He had been living in a car in the city to the American attacks.
After a year ago, nothing like a year, anything.
One day you get a secret that makes him take it up to hold, after I went up, and I would be able to get up.
He knows a group of people, which gives you a description.
It takes a little bit of money so that it was eating new role, money to send home.
They present a young one.
And then it goes home.
It starts a new life.
It has a kind of life.
A beautiful day in Mars, under a blue box -- it took a blue car.
That child of that little person with the great quality was the sub-Saharan terrorist, and that particular group of people were to the Sun, a terrible organization connected with the Tea.
So how about a child of a little kid trying to get their dream in the city with him with him to be able to make it inspire?
He was waiting on.
I was waiting for an opportunity -- waiting to start to start your future -- waiting for a future, and this was the first thing I get in.
This was the first thing that I heard about what we call the period of waiting?
And their story is made up in terms of the world.
This is the story of the markets, young people who have been able to be able to develop distributions in Johnson, and they have developed distributions in London, that you see something beyond the "Performance "prevent?
For young people, the process of the city, the big dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity -- to work, but the young people are not going to be able to be able to do in the protection of their cities.
And it's often the man that comes out of the most high streets of it.
By 2010, three of every five people who live in cities will be less than 18 years.
If we don't include people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunity.
And in my own city, Mars, 10 percent of the young young young people are designed.
70 percent doesn't work, not going to the school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to Mars last month and I went to visit the Maria Africa, the hospital.
I remember to be at that hospital hospital to think, and if I had never had it?
And if I had seen it to be in that same "Shore "Shore "prevent?
I'd have become transformation?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in Mars that month was actually to support a few percent leaders in a computer community.
It turns out to be a little bit of a sense of a few thousand dollars.
We sat out and we had an idea of ideas about the great challenges that face the city.
One of the young people in the room.
He went to the University of Mars, and he went out.
There was no work.
I remember when he said to me, I was because it was a decade of a degree, excited, frankly, was the perfect white for the other and other traditional organizations to be reconstructing.
They were looking at people like him.
But this story takes a different way.
In Republicans, the biggest thing to get out of the point to the B is the street.
A few years of the civil war has been built completely the village system, and a social may be the most easy way to move in.
You see an opportunity and the space.
It started a computer company company.
He began to be able to take care to local resources who would not be able to buy them.
I bought 10 minutes, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to explore hundreds of things during the next three years.
Why is this different story.
What does this different story.
I think that his ability to identify and take a new computer.
It is the collective spirit -- and I think that the complicated space can be the most powerful tool against the "percent person?
And I want to be the people to be the creative of economic opportunities that are looking at so definition.
And you can understand the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who came to one of my teams, Mars Mars, a flower.
I was helped to train some of the young people in the middle of the international intervention and how to be innovation.
In fact, it is the first food that Mars has seen in more than 12 years, and so far, until Mohn's came up, if you want to fly for your base, we used to be presenting from the first.
If you ask someone to someone -- "What was the last time you see free flowers?
For those who grew up during the civil war -- the answer would be -- "Amazon?
So let me see a opportunity.
It started a company company and it started a local design.
I created a lot in the Francisco of Mars, and I started to capture authorities and lights, that I said, you could survive the hard climate of France.
And it started the training of flowers for balls, creating heads in the house, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creating of the first public piece of Mars in 24 years.
There are no public particles in Mars.
I want to create a space where the families -- young people, you can go together, and as he says, I will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the private rooms.
And by the way, he has no robots because we use a lot of water.
So the first step is to interact the young people, and in that room, the President of Mono had a really deep impact in the lives.
They have never thought about a business.
They had thought to work for a U.S., working for the government, but their story, their innovation really had a strong impact about them.
And I used them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
And I put them back to believe that they could be companies that might be activity of change.
For the end of the day, you had innovation solutions for some of the most challenges that face the city.
They were influenced by local problems.
So you inspired the young people and create a computer culture is really a big step -- but the young people need to make their reality.
They need experience. They need to be able to be able to get them in the development and put out of their business.
You connect to young people with the resources that you need to give you the support that they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And for me, the food school is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact of it.
Mark is not just coming out of molecules.
I think it is a hope.
His part of people, this is how I call it, when it's created to transform the way people see their city.
And you can have been able to make kids out of the street to help to carry and keep the objects for him.
And I gave you the opportunity to get out of the particle of the space of the space?
These images are having a huge impact in their cities.
So my surface is to turn the young people in companies -- and they win and raise their immune innovation, and you'll have more stories about surfaces and Paris of the peace that bombs and "percent of hope.
Thank you.
I was about a few years old, and I went up with my father in the Mars Mars, an open area to the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The flower continues.
The sun made them go up as a vision -- and it will not be the way that we go on, we can almost imagine that we were the first human beings in the way that Earth.
We get to our field.
It was a control in a principle with a beautiful cartoon when I discovered something horrible.
In the course there was a book, from about four feet coming up with the face of public paper paradigms of food paper, and old statement.
And I was an individual, I was very excited and incredibly conflict.
The streets that were too legs like to save what they had been done, who thought I was going to call his freedom?
That question goes up with me, and it's just a little bit.
Who is our freedom?
No matter how you open or where you get the "unclear], who was called our ball in State?
Who would clean our ball in Robert or particles or in London."
So here in New York, the Department of society is our freedom, at the age of 12 tons of research and two tons of relatively producers every day.
I wanted to know how to do it.
I wanted to understand who makes that work.
What does it feel like to use the company and take that care?
So I started a research project with them.
I came in the colors and walk through their transitions and I went to people in doctors and interventions in the whole city, and I learned a lot -- but it was still a beginning.
I needed to be able to be able to get up.
So I started working as a surface record.
Now I didn't just travel in the colors. I converted them.
And I was working the mechanical and based on the sea.
It was a private principle and a learning analogy.
They all questions about the solution.
It's there, but it's not as likely as they believe -- and in the days that it's very strong to do it really quickly.
It takes a lot of teacher to the table.
I met people who had worked in it for several years and their bodies continue to get up at the way to take it on the way to take it out of their body body all the week.
It's also the dangerous.
And I learned with the office of the Grand States, the resource of research is one of the most dangerous choices of the country, and I learned the right.
You're getting up and focus on the traffic every day and they go out to your around.
You just want to go through it, so in order to be able to be paying attention.
That's very bad for work.
And also the forest is full of dangers that are often coming out of the walk and they would be able to make a terrible day.
I also learned about how much of the balloon.
When you get out of the cost and you see a city from the country of the country, you will understand that the bacteria is like a force of nature in it.
I never stop coming on.
It's also like a form of responsibility or collaboration.
It always has to be in movement.
And it's also the future.
It seems like the station is special especially because I think the records of results are the most important way in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
It's the first practice of public health.
If you don't get out of the definitions and effective every day, this starts to be able to be able to be able to go out of their conditions and their international dangerous interventions in a very real way.
The diseases that we had control for decades and used to go back and start to give them to give you a day.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get away from the old thing we don't have space for what the materials of the economy.
I'm not going to stay through the careers, I used to be your reality.
And then this is what I call our average public ability to need to.
And with it with it just to the speed of the speed that we used to move into the time.
We certainly don't worry about us, and we did not be able to take us with us with us our care car -- our back of the control, our back of water.
We use them, we take them out of them, because we know there is a work of work on the other side that will come out of it.
So today, I want to be able to be a couple of ways of thinking about the resources that maybe help to reduce the station and put them into that conversation about how to design a survival and human city.
His work, I think, is kind of light.
They are on the street every day in the top every day, in the way.
They use a method in many cities.
You know when they would expect it.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of authority.
The flow that keep us left us from ourselves from us, from our own development, our own details, and that food should always keep a way or another one.
One day after the 11 percent of 19th percent of the 2009, I heard the group of a record of the rest in the streets in the street, and I would take my little scale and I had a man who had a man who did all of the role of paper as I did all the missions.
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day in particular, but I started to read it.
And I looked at me and I just looked at me, and he said, "We are going to be good.
We're going to be okay.
So I started after that I started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see that man.
It's called Paul Paulo, we worked together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our effort to make the way that we're going on in this planet as a species we have to get up and have all the cost of the cost -- even the human cost of the way to work.
We think that what we think about when we talk about it, they get the three of the amount of the rest of the context.
This is a remarkable state.
So in the flow of your day and their life, the next thing you see to someone whose work is to call the forest of you, I read a moment to recognize them.
I take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the concept of thinking about our fundamental life part of the environment where the authority was born from the conditions and local transportation.
There are two percent projects like this.
And both of these projects are in extraordinary countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Park.
And so they make the fact that the different attention from different species are going to become an essential part of the end of the artificial work.
The first example started with an investment to design a solid center of a lot of signals in the capital of Europe, Anderson Adam.
This is the kind of building that we would show us as example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out of here?
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city -- we realized that there are three important things to go down.
In the beginning, these buildings are almost valuable because they have very big decades where people can't be able to be able to be able to buy things.
Second, you need to share a lot of energy because the rest with the control with the control of the instrument, so it's needed a lot of information.
In a city that this should not happen because it's about a huge climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And in third of all, you have nothing to do with Africa not with Europe.
This is a little bit about a place that is so rich in culture and traditional and traditional things.
In our first visit to Time, I actually really care with the old market that is this structure to the air where thousands of people, and they buy things every day to small self-assembles.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate the outside activity to generate it.
And so I thought, that was what I really wanted to design -- not a commercial center of it.
But the question was how to build a building model of various boys, using these principles up.
The next challenge is present when the site is based on a lot of a lot of a much growth growth of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture.
And it's also between two particular streets that are not going to communicate in a hundreds of hundreds of hundred feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets -- using all of the infrastructure of the building.
And this is going on with an animal attack that creates a space on the air in the building that will be able to get up, by their own form of the sun and the language.
And around this space we have opened the idea of the market with small business -- which changes in every step because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building.
I wanted to find a solution that answer the local climate conditions to do.
And I asked me to think about a similar transport to a head of ants to allow care of the air and also from the light, but in a financial way.
Then we are inspired in these basis of the seasons of the states.
They have the properties of the financial George and this helped me to move the factor.
We are building that with these small pieces that are the window that they stop going through the air and the light in the inside of the building.
This is complicated with these little companies of colors that control the light of the inside of the building to avoid the building over the night.
With these ideas didn't be able to convince the development because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what we did?
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the death was going to be a lot more relevant than the fundamental center because at the end of the world there was more local to sell it.
And the idea of the face was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material in compared with the video but also because it was no longer need to have air air.
So we got some of us in the surface that we use to increase the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy energy for the building in a city in which electricity is close to almost every day.
So we got a great version by putting pictures in the roof.
And then under those plants we think about the team as a new public space with areas and back that they would create this little basis.
And these guys in the record, which in a place they get water for the sounds of the Internet.
You hope for the first year, because we go through the course of the construction of construction ...
And the second example is a seat of 200 applications and services in the city of Tim.
And to make a project so big -- the largest that I have designed -- I need not just to understand the city of Alzheimer, but also their environment and the culture.
And for that device I was used to use in the measure -- an structure of 100 years of anti-stars that was surrounded by a box with a dog with a dog with a dog with the legs that are almost recently.
When I went back to the place, the first set of design that we did was to be able to be able to be able to be able to take up a 12 major colleagues in size and short in the way that there is in Latin and other cities in Europe with these kids.
It was about that, we had a few percent points in relationship to the idea of the door distances with the rest of the records -- and this means the initial model.
And the last generation was to think of the cells, the small cell of the project, like the application, as a particular part of the plan of the phone.
I thought, what would be the best goal for a documentation in the medical climate call.
And it's North, because it creates a traditional difference between both side of the house and so a natural version of it.
So we have a school that sure most of the apples are perfectly interested in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European white and the Congress city.
It has these balls with pathways, and then in the low room we have all the conditions for people.
And it also respond to the local neurons that are going to be a greater center in the surface and a better disease on the bottom planet.
And I also reduce this idea of the dances.
The team -- which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to reduce the space of the space to build the construction of the building.
This is where all of them, they can come up and survive, and make activity as a couple of two miles per morning, or save a building to another.
These two examples have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in extraordinary countries, where you can see the cities literally growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's life of people change the communities and local economic economy that grow the building.
For this reason, I see even more important to look for the architecture looking for simple solutions.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new little child in our class -- it was so proud -- like you see all the new children.
He had a lot of a very brilliant little amount of very brilliant and a little bit of characters, and it was sure for the care of the states, very good for artists.
I ended up that year and I was full of cells, until I took my beautiful person.
One day I took a time after the side of school. It was a little bit later, and I told me in the baby of the kids.
When the cost was dead, I went back in the client room, I took out of the table.
And then I did.
And I love the schools of my role, just a little bit like that.
All of it.  And I was going to give you the book to the country, but to see, some of my other computers had very good at all.
So in a Africa, I took the news all the way all the world, without any imagination without any picture.
I asked all of them to go out and myself and myself just like this, just because I could be there, because I could be there.
I still amazing what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I was good to do it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I was never going on.
It is that it was all a sense of additional administration.
I never found me.
But about all of all, I get the reason why I was given that this planet, so small -- it was so good to grow up.
And I was inspired by the chains.
They are so microbes and so on.
We know that the babies will come from them.
And also the principles -- the blue banks are very projects.
And we know that the cells are the number one of us in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that causes the solar or the long direct or the transport.
So you have to go to the factory, because governments are like the lab that they study the cells in all their possible.
In fact, I don't know if it is an responsibility to say that if there was no cells, there would be also light.
Well, I would not have Hello the invisible, no "short?
There would not be what I didn't have to do -- or a night.
There would be no Southern.
They have the laws of high school, because we would be losing "The Robot and the France," there would be no "State or "for "for "Sort of "Canada?
There is no presentation. I know that it is going to say it has the answer for all, and in the top of the things, almost that it has all of them.
This year is just 100 years of their work -- which is looking for the time lost, the most successful study of the sexual cells and also of the original communication -- all of what we could have --  -- everything we could have.
We thought about a child trying to build the surface.
We think about a horrific market in you.
We will take us out of what that image is.
We love what it is.
I mean, it is about books that Virgin San said were as hard as a car street.
I don't know how it is the operating tape, but we know it's supposed to be surface.
Let's see why they're going to go so good together, and the colleagues and cells and Professor.
It will be very obvious as the teachers who are reduce to the person, to their table, to their employees, are a good corrupt baseball?
I don't know. I believe that we got very close to the door when we think about what happens when we feel true.
When we feel cells, we tell us the same story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
It is going to be at the time and authority, we know exactly what they are going to even be able to get the child, right?
The cells are making us all of us who are able to be able to be able to get a little bit to understand it.
Everything that she does to give me to be able to give it to another time, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, I think that every thing I found is that it was surrounded in his love -- you open it to his computer control in their own private camera in his own private camera in their own private camera in his own private.
You have to admit that David and President, they were absolutely true.
You know, the North North notes would have to deal with the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so close to recognize that it's a hard work. Right?
The cells are standard.
It's an emotional emotions -- you have to feed it.
And what are the chairs?
The cells are numbers of information.
The cells use the discovery.
And the cells like the great amount of biological weight and the next amount of charges.
The cells are born from the picture.
That's why India is such as successful --  -- President is going to be able to take the language.
When John is in his birds of cells, I think I hear behind the door and release to the seasons of his love, then to make those behavior.
He says, "Look, I know you think that this is record, but it's not different to the interaction of an old term or to see a movie?
He says, "You are scientific research with real value very internationally?
Project is trying to show that the students are going to see that you can see interviews and make us seem to be able to seem out, but in their mind, they are serious from the truth of the truth of the truth -- a real dance -- in fact, the more pain the truth.
The dolphin, the human hard, the discovery, these were the ones that are going on with the subject room.
He says, "Do you have a woman who needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of some of a lot more profound and video than a man who can be interested?
We're saying that we're going to look for the construction women.
No, I think it's trying to say that the cells will take us to ourselves.
And there is some other impact that makes us love in this very particular way.
There's some other emotional emotions to us.
So some other emotions that I taught us to look at the personalize thing to look at a personalize thing?
And I would write about this more away.
A day, I was seen by a very amazing young young thing that was connected with the idea that his woman was doing it.
And Africa says that there was something strange in this man, who didn't look at what his wife did was that he did his wife down.
So she was international -- all the world knew it.
The poor critical was under a surprise without any cause of it.
But he was looking for things that makes their wife without having to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to continue it.
It sounds too much -- or you can hear the room with a man.
And he said that the man was going to become the subject of your wife of his wife of his wife out.
The holes are very good at this.
The holes describe very well how the cells are doing us to look at it, but without pressure without it.
In fact, the more interesting cells we are, more we are going to turn it into the factory of the fantastic.
And for this reason, I think, the cells are getting us to make human act or lights.
The cells are going to be able to show us in a completely exciting way.
Now I'm thinking about me about eight years -- I recognized it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michael of 15 years of age was able to be created to have created a street in Facebook from the one that was sent to me in the way that he was sent to me, for a year.
For a year. All a year.
She was trying to get up to the new subject of his own submission. I have to trust that when or this, they do with advantage.
Because we will be reality.
So what the enormous thing is, even though a distribution, right?
It's kind of as a note.
As a novel of Paris Chinese.
History is one of my family.
She is a very strange character and beautiful of American light.
This is the article of "Seat in a Treat and "The TED Talk, "Little, books that are trying to take the cells, and then once we are in the experience, and once we are in the experience, the member that it might be, it can be a performance in a smart.
Let's take Talk Republican, their most famous person.
And I love Republican is going to do or wanted what you have to get out of your going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of what you ever have, and it's under the floor.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the rock of Rome Reader.
I can't give you the entire world, as well as sometimes like that.
It's a little bit, because we live in time.
We live in the time.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks where the control is the investment? Right?
The holes show us the side? I'm not sure here.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe -- when they are for a mission to it.
We're going to go back to the 1860s from Bang Steve and ask by Shanday Haiti.
When people think of honest, you think of the market of the Mars Mars in the Mars Mars, that critical generation.
But I have always been a primary "State of the story -- the experience face of San Arab that I need to take the Hollywood designers, it needs the grandmother of honest, but it was married.
And so it sounds so familiar to me.
It needs your help -- but it takes it, and it turns out that it would happen in the each one of the microscopes.
But how to work together, something starts to change, and finally in the Solia Singarary Allens, once you have the side of the side of his solution.
Are we proud of you?
And it tells you that there is no one person in San Army that I don't want to hear your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see homework in the story. I think this is a very exciting thing that looks like this -- that's also microbes, right?
It seems to bring the cells as a beautiful problem, no environment.
You know, in a Harvard mind is on the right side of it.
The next minute are the same side.
And suddenly it allows you to leave that idea of being a result.
Can it still be so simple?
What happens if the cells are really a question of game, just a question of where we can be in relationship to the other.
Well, maybe we don't have to be able to feel from the rest of the other.
We can take it with it.
But I like the plants of control.
So as we hope that that country, we remember that we have the science to be able to make it.
Just the fact that the chain is carefully.
The factory used to be the teachers, I invited you to the table.
And you look at what I was going to look at the surface of the Lander, the Arab called Richard, the Lind Line, the San Mars Protect.
We are in a stage company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
And the 24 percent of 1950 1990s, British Arab came out of the movie of the 19th movie and described about the Maria Maria.
Audience and Latin were used -- but his present in the grandmother surface was the colleague of a collective collective process.
The Arab program.
In order to get to the more -- NASA has a lot of 150 billion dollars of today, or three percent of the factory spread.
The Gandhi was working on about 400 people and asked the collective of 20 companies and University of the government.
They would make people, including the Australia of the Arab one.
But before the Prize Project provided -- 24 men worked to the Latin.
And they were walking on the surface of the surface of the down in the down of Steven the last year, is now the most notion.
So, why did they do?
They did not have a lot of blood, 3D biologists of old rocks, and something that the age of the age of the end of the small and a new sense of the small and the factory of our common home.
Why did it be? The clinical answer is that they were because the President President wanted to go to the substantial, that this nation had better children.
But the World words in the University in the University of Richard is given a better idea.
John Four. King, some people ask me, why do I the Montana."
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask it, why would you scale the most high mountain.
It's 35 years ago, why would you fly on the America?
Why do you play right against States?
We were going to go to the Latin.
We choose to go to the Mars.
We wanted to go to the moon in this decade and doing other things, not because they are simple, but because they're hard.
They call Polescent Poles: for consequences, the Arab was not just a solid of the rest of the rest of the Francisco war.
In the world, the most strong choice was the way that we were going to kill the temperature of the power of technology.
They were because it was a great power to do.
The bottom in the moon happened in a lot of a long list of a long technology of technology.
The first half of the 20th century.
In half of the century, it took the collection and it would take the virus.
The technology seemed to be able to be able to be able to happen in 100 called "care control?
For most of the history of humanity -- we couldn't go faster than a back, or a bank with a line, but in 2010, the Arctic of the Arab 10 went to 40 miles a 40 miles a day.
Since 1950, no human will have come to the Moston.
No one has worked faster than the top of the 19th 10, and the opportunity of the power of technology has gone to see that the problems that we imagine that we imagine that the technology was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be interviewed to Mars, or feed the world population to have been able to have turned out to be
I remember the device of the 1980s 18.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they don't look at the supercondition of the School San Sandara.
I knew that this would be the last military mission but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colleagues in Mars.
So this is what it happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We put it all the time.
We've heard it over the two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technology.
There's nothing bad in most of these things.
They have advertising and increase our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems.
What happened?
There is a profit explain in Similar visualization, that you find that you have created less effective companies that those of the years in the ones that they were made by the Internet, Mars, Republican and George.
Similar Village says that the market is the plants, the institutions that the records of risk are able to get the companies.
It says Valley says that the secret version is that they can change the creative of international ideas for the factory of international problems or even bad problems.
But I don't think that this explain is good enough.
It takes a little bit of what's going wrong what it's going to do is very bad in Vietnam Valley.
Even when the risks of risk were in the right point without worried about the risk -- they would create small individuals that they could come out in 10 years.
The Christian.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep people.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted it.
NASA has even designed a planet.
But I will go to Mars to get a political decision that was possible, and that will never happen.
We will not go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can not solve the big problems because the political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the world's entire energy power comes out of red energy source as the solar -- the choose and the biological and the bear of the two percent.
The car and the natural gas are more bacteria than energy and electricity, and the oil is more than the ball.
We want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put it into the process.
Now, the technologies and the companies and the economy are learning about what political and they were trying to figure out the development of a automatic power of a straight energy -- a significant point in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the course of the control.
But there is no hope in the political change that we will see an energy power of the United States or international trying to be able to do that connect to it.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technology, they would not be going to be.
We know from a time that the habits are the result of the Africa.
But 30 years.
The technology can improve things like the costs or the systems for the station and record of food, but there will be a fear while there are bad governments there.
Finally, the great problems sometimes a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nigeria President will give you the war to the cancer.
The social problems.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we know, but these four elements have to be present: political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the solution -- and we have to be able to understand it.
The Michael mission has become something like a metaphor for the technology of the technology to solve big problems -- it goes up with those critics.
But it's a professional model in the future.
We are not in 1999.
There is no sensitive compassion like the World War -- there is no policy like John Kenya that has a difficult thing and the oil -- and there is not a computer science of science science like to explain the solar system.
In general, you will go to the moon to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I didn't even solve any problem.
We are just in our present -- and the solutions of the future will be more difficult than that.
God knows that you don't have the records.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about the behavior, and I'm going to start to begin to remind you the ideas that are going to be on the behavior.
They are so common that they have become all of our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a record, there has been a lot of design of understanding -- is a very general belief to it.
The second is a general, we should have more conflict.
And the third is a transformation, we should be able to reduce the consequence.
I think the record, the goal and the task have been wrong.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a recently, an object and a task, that I think it gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust is distributed?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence -- I don't know the answer.
I think I can think that it may have been done in some activity or institutions that I could have increase in others.
I don't have a clear thing.
But I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of the opportunity of the opportunity of the understanding that the behavior has been discovered.
When you look at the supplies of the time, there are not many evidence of it.
It is to say, the people who were described about 20 years ago, and then we were literally previously presenting and political and they are going to be inspired by the same design.
And the people who were very excited about 20 years ago, they will still be quite completely constructed to be quite constructed."
The rest of us are in the middle -- and, by the way, the average city of the street is almost about half of the way.
But this is this enough.
So what the control schools are, of course, operations.
What else can you remember?
What you look at is the genes that people know when you make certain questions.
So I trust the policy? I trust the metaphors?
Now if someone will ask you, "What do you ask in the solutions?
You put into the particles.
Do you see the private properties?
I would probably start to say, "What do you have to do this?
And that would be a very sensitive answer for that.
And you might say, when you've got your question -- "Well, I think in some -- but in each other.
Which is very radical.
In fact, in real life, we tend to design the trust in a different way.
We don't know that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a kind of able to be able to be able to be able to work or kind of person, is going to be better in all the case.
I could say, for example, I'm going to say that I have a certain show that I know to give you the kind of reading -- but in any way to bring the static friends.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good control.
I could focus on my most local friend to keep a conversation but no, maybe to give you a secret of it.
simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our life lives in the way that the trust is different, why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more open way more observed?
And I think the schools are very bad tools to measure the real level of real conflict -- because they try to encourage the good intervention of the fact that they are going to trust something or something.
Secondly, what happens to the democracy?
The goal is to have more conflict.
First, I think it is a wonderful thing.
This is not the thing that I would stay.
I would try to have more trust in what it looks like is what it looks like.
In fact, I'm an opportunity to not trust what it's not able to trust it.
And I think that those people who did their states with very clearly called Mr. Marine, that then I think about them, I think of them, and I think, well, you know, it was too much.
It will have more trust is not an intelligent object in this life.
You understand designer or black with intelligence -- that's the right thing.
Once you say it, you say, yes, that means that what matter that matter is not the behavior, but the control.
And what it's about is to make a record about how much the people are the people in order to determine.
And I think that to be able to make a subject, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're completely completely honest? Are they responsibility?
And if we found that a person is a place in the before, and it is responsible for it, and it's responsible for a very good reason to trust in it, because it's going to be design of control.
But yes, by the way, they're not responsible -- we could not be able to trust them.
I have friends who are companies and gentlemen, but I didn't trust them to take a close to the right, because they're alive.
I have friends that are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that it would be surprised their own companies.
And I really got a lot of saying that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are going to be companies and responsible for it.
If it's like this, I still haven't heard me.
But that's what we are looking for is what we're looking for.
The trust is the answer.
Interview is what we have to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems of record for all kinds of institutions.
Many of those systems have had the collective effect.
They don't work.
I remember once I was talking to a couple and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the little bit of me?
And we found the same problem in all our public life, and international life, that the risk system that has been made to support the trust and the transformation test -- actually is doing the control.
What you do is to make the work of the people who have to make different distances, like the parts -- you will make them the sides, as we say the sides?
I sure you all know similar example.
All of that, for the goal of the environment.
I think the goal should be more complex, and that things would be different if we try to be made of trust and we treat the people that we are constructed and if we try to figure out whether other people or political or policy are different.
It's not easy -- it's the relationship, the simple access -- the activists, what you don't do.
In the third of all, the task.
So called the way to be able to be able to be able to get the things to the restaurant.
It suggests that you and I should recognize the trust of it.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can get a little bit.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to improve the trust of it.
But the understanding -- it is really different because we have a lot of other people.
You can't figure out what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough enough so that they can trust you.
You have to be kind of consequence.
And that, of course, is because you can't get it, for all people, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to support some of them that you are difficult of control.
How do you do that?
That makes a day, in all parts -- it makes the common people, the interventions, the interventions, very quickly.
I'm going to give you a simple commercial example.
And I took it back to me when I bought my colleagues that I can take you without giving them without giving them.
You take them up and get me into the money, or I will change them for the color that I want.
That is strong. And I know in them because they came back to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you go back to the other part of the other part, that's a very good test that you're different to trust and you have trust in what you're saying about.
So in the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very difficult thing.
In what people trust is in the relationships -- and in that market, you can end up when and how the other person is made of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of the computers we have seen us to reduce the solution between us and digital information, the situation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the image can be done.
This self-assembly has been going on, and more and more and more and more at the point that today is at least one of the less than one month -- the hope of the video of the vision of a case -- and the power of information has become access to all.
But I said, and if there was no brains?
I started to imagine how it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so when it was the top of the screen on the screen it takes their physical body.
The designers can kill their ideas right on 3D ideas -- and the students can be able to practice with virtual organs on the screen.
And so with this tool you get the barriers.
But the two hands.
How do you get into the inside and interact with digital information using all of the distances of the hands?
In the University of Science Allens of Mexico, together with my mind Alsold Bangladesh, he developed the computer.
It will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to detect the forest and the face -- now you can take the hands of the team, to get to the inside of the 3D space, and they will take them directly directly with the hands.
And as the window and the artists have a relationship in the real space, you will get them as easy as to take a book of a state of a state.
You can take the book and transform light or words with the virtual feeling that there is on the bottom of the flower street.
We can be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reduce their hands directly with the hands.
In these examples we put in the digital world.
And if we invented the role and make the digital information go back to us?
Now, many of us will have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
And what I have here is a virtual test for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a discovery in the head or transformation when you understand the system of your body.
So if we take this idea, I thought, instead of just looking at them in space, how can we make them make a physics so that we could be able to put them into the way we could be able to do it and sense them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make them
How would it be a future like this?
And at the middle of MIT Monteris with my Audience Shanghai Mission and my colleagues Republican Park, we created this only physical film plan.
And this issue is a company as a pain in the space in space in space -- which is that it means that so much the computer is going to move the object to any place in this little special space.
Simple, what we did was that we did it and control the movement by the movement of a magic level, and medical and decentralized levels and decentralized.
And when you produce the object, we get it out of the transportation of the time and space -- what it means to say that human movement can get and come back and come back and go back in the physical world.
You can teach particularly and discussion and the famous takes of Michael John can be able to reduce as a physical reality.
The students can use it as a tool to understand companies like the movement of the planet, the physics -- and by the mathematics or the movies or the terms of terms, this is a real experience.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world will be going to change our physical physical lives.
As you see, the digital information is not just to show you something but to start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that we have to get out of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a back, but if we take that brain, the only thing that is our imagination is our imagination of our picture.
Thank you.
And I was sent to turn it up for two years in Haiti, China, in the 1990s.
When I was in the first degree -- the government wanted to be able to be a school for all the particles with all of the particular passions.
But my mother said, no.
My parents wanted me to turn me to me, like them.
And then I was able to survive the cultural revolution -- they create a lot that had only a whole way to happiness.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was going to be a child of the China.
This was me, in my picture.
It has to begin to go back from a very young man to learn the reactions, so I tried everything I could to go to the subject of the hole.
And until I wrote to the distribution of school and the beginning of a radio program.
But there is no adult to the idea.
No audience took me in series to me.
I just had my friends to me, but they were children -- no automatic, as I me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to understand it.
My dream would never make it.
It takes that during the rest of my life a high school was the only one to what it could be.
And this was so incredible.
So I was looking for another video.
No one to my around I wanted to tell you.
And I went to the books.
"And "I was "show "Competen Steve Charles Chinese "The Highth Story "Story -- I got to the United States -- and what were the first words that I read here?
What they were provided in China, of course.
"The Great Earth is about the Chinese life.
And it's not being able to be able to be able to understand it.
The Bible is interesting.
That's a story for another day.
But the man who was going to be a record of me was a record, "World to your father and your father, to your father and your father.
"Holow, I said, "It's so different, and much better than help."
So it became my tool to go out of this piece of control and to remember the relationship with my parents with my parents.
I found it with a new culture as well.
British a lot of perspective.
For example, this map of this map looks like a place of place because this is what the students in China.
There was nothing that had been happened to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map impact the perspective of people.
The collective law is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the average world.
There are to the research field of research as a complicated relationship and complicated light.
And I would share and control, he was able to get a more profound understanding of a issue.
And I thought that if the collective lesson worked to research, why not do it in life life.
So I started reading books from two.
You can try to try to be a Broadway Brooklyn Bank: "The Japanese Standard "The Japanese Day of David Mars who were involved in one system, or friends.
By the crime, the tools are economic and political and specific and specific.
For the Boston, they are all particles, building, and it will have a social thing.
If you know another language, it's also fun.
"The San Talk Talk Talk Talk Talk Mars Mars "The way of the San Japanese instead instead of losing in the transformation, I found that you can take a lot of it.
For example, it's through the traditional that I realized that "Mars in China literally means "short factory?
And "I know in China, literally means new mother."
And the books came up with a massive door to connect with people from the past and the present people.
I know that will not be used to be used to be used to be an important one.
It will have a hard dream really not is anything compared with what many other people have happened.
I have come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a car.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that they come out and where the passion comes from.
It was to a terrible dream can do that for you.
And it is because of the books -- I'm here today, happy to live with presentation and collective, most of the time.
So the books.
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
And when I was in my years, I saw my first kind of plastic climate.
And I was a drug study in the city of college personality.
She was a 24 years called Alaback.
Alexander went back to the first feeling using the states and a morning park, you would look at the side of my office was sent up and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard that, I felt so straight.
My whole piece of kind had a little bit like the first one.
And I took a video I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't did.
With the Chinese stories that Adam tried to the signs, I was able to just move the head while we were looking at the solution.
"The trial is the new videos: I said, "Architecture, and so I saw -- she was right.
You start to work after it, it gets home later, he has children later, until the death happens later.
In order to go up and I was time to work.
But a little bit later, my supposed to get me to protect Art than talking about his life life.
I mean, I was right.
I said, "You know, it's coming up with guys under his career, it goes up with a head of it, but it's not as if it was going up with it.
And then my surface said, "No, but maybe it goes up with the next one.
And also, the best moment to work on the Mars of Alab is before it is caused?
This is what the police is called a moment "Mom."
It was when I realized that the age is not the new 20 percent.
Yes, people feel head after what it looks like. But this didn't make the 20 percent of Art were a pattern in their development in their development.
This made the 20 percent of America were the perfect moment and we were sending.
And so I realized that this kind of black birth was a real problem, and I had real things, not just for America and his love, but for the careers, the families and the future of all of all of them.
There are five million viruses in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population or 100 percent if you know that nobody came to the adults without going through the 20th.
They read your hand if you're in its 200 percent.
I want to see the villages here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with videos, you love a village, you take up the dream a virus, I want to see. It's good. It's good.
This is not just my attention. These are the fact that these are the done.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and times "Mover, that you give it to their life would have gone to when you have 30 and so on.
And people of more than 40 percent of it -- not to be able to be able to take a particular.
This public is going to be good.
We know that the first 10 years of a car have an emotional impact about the amount of money that will make them.
We know more than half of the Americans are happening, they live or they're coming out with their future for 30 years.
We know that the brain took their second and the last set of growth in their 200 and it is represented for the adult, which means if there's something you want to change themselves -- now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the perspective changes more times for their 200 than the time of the other time of life, and we know that the fundamental factor comes to their transition to the 28, and things become complicated at the age of 25 percent.
The 20 is the time to focus on their body and their own.
When we think about the development of the kids, we all know that the first five years are critical to the language and the boat in the brain.
It's a moment in which their daily life and common has an impact on the person who will become it.
But what we don't listen to is that there is something called the adult and our 20 percent of them are a critical moment.
But this is not what the viruses are here.
The legs talk about changes on the time of the adult.
The researchers call the 20 percent extraction in the end of it.
The periods are going to take them down to the villages like "The "little "States and "The "States?
It's true.
As a culture -- we have created a typical of what is actually the decade that I decided the adult.
read Benjamin said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when you give them a window in the head and say, have another 10 years to start your life?
It doesn't happen.
They gave up that person the sense of property and their activity.
And then all of the days all the day, smart people, interesting like you or their children and children come to my office and say something like that, "I know my name is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't tell you.
Or say, "You all say that while it looks like a car before the age -- everything will be okay.
But then it starts to make something like that, "The 200 are on the end and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better culture the day that I got from the context?
And then it starts to sound something like this.
They all run and money, but then at some point around the 30 -- the music came up and all began to sit away.
I didn't want to be the only one who will be about it, so I sometimes I think I get with my wife because he was the most short century when he had 24.
Where are the players here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit, but they don't measure -- the risks are very high today.
When you leave a lot of things for the three, there is a huge pressure to the trial and so many of them to start a career, to choose a city -- to choose a part, and to get two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not computer, and there are research that starts to show you, which is much more difficult and trying to do everything at the time.
So the media of the average age is not about to buy a red degrees of red degrees.
It's about realize that you can't have the face you want now.
I realize you can't have the son who you want to do now, or you can't give you a brother to your children.
A lot of transportation and surgery are going to look at themselves, and to me, sitting on the room, and they talk about the room, "What was I doing?
I want to change what the viruses are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it could be.
It's a story about a woman named English.
And at the age of the year, I took my office because I was -- in his own words, having an identity of identity by having an ideas.
He said he would like to work on the art or the intervention, but it still couldn't be able to decide -- so I spent the last few years working as a way.
And as it was the more basic, I lived with a sun that I showed a lot more that I was going to look at more than anybody.
And despite a few very difficult life, his entire life had been even more difficult as well.
And I would take it up in our sensors, but then he was left to say, "You don't choose your family -- but you can choose your friends?
Well, one day I came up with his head about his legs and I call it all the time.
I was just going to buy a new book for the diagram, and I had spent all the morning to get it with his whole many, but then he was looking at the water space that goes back after the words and the words called the footage?
I was at the point of the story when I saw me, and he said, "What's going to be for me if I have an authority access to me if I have a care access?
Who is going to take me if I'm going to be able to close to me.
At that time, I spent a lot of work and I would not say, "I won't say, "I don't say, "I don't say that.
What I needed was not a transport that was really concerned about it.
I would need a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I was working with Alaback as to just sit out of the fact that I was going to feel in front of English.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to me about three things that all of it, man or woman -- I would have to know.
First of all, I said to Emiso that he was forget from that ideas of identity and you have an identity of ideas.
On the ability of identity -- I mean how to do something that was worth to his person.
It will do something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of English, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this -- I know that this is a control of identity of identity of identity of ideas.
So now this is the moment for that working side of the country in the country, of that company that you want to try to transform it.
I'm not going to find out the strange explanation -- I'm going to figure out that it should not be able to tell you, that, by the way, it's not exploring.
It's present.
I said to English that would explore work and it would make them.
Second, I told you to example that the words are surprised.
The best friends are strange to bring it into the artist, but the amounts that are going on with friends with similar mental minds that you know, what you know -- what do you know, how do you think, how do you talk about, and where do you work.
That new piece of causes -- that new person who would go out of this always comes out of his most short carbon.
The new things come from what they call the diamonds of diamonds of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the viruses have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the diagram visions are the way to put this group.
And the half of the work would never be able to put up, then, to know the fish of your notion is the way to get a work that was not published by all.
It is not going to make the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not less importantly, I think you don't choose to their family but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a surface, I was able to put her family to his family. When you have a party and form his own family.
I said to exact the time to choose his family to choose his family there.
Maybe you think that the 30 percent is better age to sit out that the 20 or even 25 and I can agree with you.
But I would choose the person with the people who live right now, or you go right now when everyone in Facebook begin to walk into the oil is not progress.
The best moment to work in your husband is before you have it, and that means to be so excited in the love as you're in the work.
It has to get your family to be a aware of who and what's what they want instead of just to work to work or make a time with you that you get them to you.
So what about English?
Well, we take that direction, and she found the space of four of an art that was working in a art.
This dialogue disappeared to get a work there.
That work of work gave you a reason to leave the night that I lived in.
Now, five years later, it is kind of kind of species of events in mothers.
This house with a man who has been aware of.
I love his new face, I love his new family -- and I got a letter that he said, now the experts of evidence are not the big enough.
The story of East can be easy, but that's what I love to work with with virus.
It's very easy to help you.
The food are like adults that come from the authority of the Northernily, which is going to some place of it.
Just before I went out of the speech, a little girl in his train makes the difference between the difference of the difference or in Francisco.
In the same way, at the age of the age of the age of the age of 24 and even at the age -- a good conversation -- a good thing -- a good TED talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
So here this is my idea of telling all of the viruses that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell you.
This is what I have now is the ability to tell you how to be able to go up with the eyes every single day -- the trains are not the new two -- you get the newspapers -- you get their adult, to be able to be able to be able to make your family, they get their dark visions.
They don't let you decide so they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They are doing their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 24 years old, I took a very recent job on a work of a work that was even more experts: the discovery.
I was going to teach us a little bit of marketing teachers in the public schools in New York.
And as any teacher -- and it will go out and test them.
And I give you them.
When the work comes back, I took the characters.
What I call me was that Congo. It wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students, and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students and my worst students, and my worst
Some of the people who had a better designer they had no specific contexts of Chinese.
Some of my most intelligent children was not going to give them so well.
And that asked me to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in terms of grandmother, are so hard -- democracy, democracy, the area of a galaxy.
But these conditions are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they were going hard and during the enough.
After a few more years later, I got to the concept that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and the learning from a moral perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in better way.
It's the Carolina, but what happens if you have success in school, and in the life of a lot more than the ability to learn differently.
So I went out the car and I went to the universe to become paper.
I started to study kids and adults in all kinds of discussion -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and Why?
My team of research and I went to the American Mario West.
We try to predict what cities are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reach and who they will do.
We went to the National National Control, and we tried to predict what children will provide the most possible thing.
And we study the non-profit teachers working on really difficult self, asked what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school and the school and the state of those who are the most effect to improve the results of the understanding of their students.
We used to be able to be able to be able to say, "What about these senses are going to keep their way of working your job of work.
And who is going to make more money.
In all of those very different context, it came up with a marketing as a major period of the success.
And it was not the social innovation.
It wasn't the good thing, the physical health and it wasn't the Color.
It was the democracy.
And democracy is passion and periodic to make a lot of very long players.
The relationship is to have resilience.
The relationship is to go to their future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The device is to live life as if it was a market, not a care to all of it.
A few years ago, I started to study the description in the public school.
I asked thousands of high school students who would make my destruction and then I hope about over a year to see who they would get in.
It turns out that the children with more definition they had a lot of a lot of more likely to get out, even when you put them into every care that I could measure -- things like the family income -- the results of the starting tests, even the security that they were in the school.
So it's not only in the New page or in the National Congo of Francisco in which you care about designer. It's also in school.
So for me, the most important thing about democracy is the little bit that we know, the little bit of science about their development down.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the discovery in the kids.
What should I do to teach the kids a single site of work.
How do I put them down for the local light?
The most honor answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that the technology doesn't give them to change.
Our data would look very clearly that there are lots of things that are just not going to be able to get with their companies.
In fact, in our data, democracy is not related or is even involved in the fact that we have to be involved to the tasks of the talent.
And so far, the best idea I've heard about developing in kids is something called growth "care?
This is a developed idea in the University of South Dr. and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not listening, that it can change with the hope.
Dr. Rome has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and I grew up in response to the challenge -- they're much more likely to improve when they figure, because they don't believe that that film is a perfect conservation.
So the sense of growth is a great idea to develop democracy.
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to end up my design, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have in front of it.
We need to take our best ideas, our most strong institutions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they have been expensive, and we have to be willing to be willing to work, to begin to begin with all of the lessons with the lessons that you learn to do with the lessons learning with the lessons with the lessons of the lessons of it.
In other words, we need to be defined to make our kids more designed.
Thank you.
It grew up in terms like the daughter of a care, one of my most sophisticated records is my mother showing the beauty -- the shape and the force of Chinese careers.
From that moment, I was wonderful about this incredible language.
But for a freedom, it seems to be as amazing as the Great China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can be asking this death -- so that I want to understand that I want to understand and learn the beauty of this service to do it.
And I started thinking about how a new new and quality to learn China could be useful could be together.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the ones in every face in the right sequence in the right.
I learned new care every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese activity would buy 20 percent.
You just need a thousand to understand basic authority.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic language, enough enough to read services of transportation, to understand the basic idea of the water or the periods.
Today, you start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are they ready?
They open your mouth as much as it can be possible until it is a strange.
They get a ball.
This is a person who's going to give a point.
person.
If the form of the front is a person in both side, as if they were freedom in front of it, "Man: I'm going to be working? This system is actually adapted in the way I call it, but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a robot.

This is a mountain.
The sun.
So it takes it.
The system of the door is like a couple of a pattern in the old sea.
And we call these eight forests.
These are balloons of building so that they think a lot of corals.
One person.
If someone walk back, that's sure.
As the ancient says the old said, two are company, three are married.
If one person would be their arms -- this person is saying it was like this is like this.
The person in the base, the person is taken up.
This is a pressure -- just like Johnson inside the bank.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a food.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You put a tape under the tree -- we have the chairs.
They put a battery on the tree -- that's a "Little."  easy to remember -- because a particular tree is pretty idea.
Do you remember the fire?
Two pieces together, it makes a lot of high.
Three food.
They put the fire under the two trees -- that's going on.
So for us, the sun is the source of professional.
Two sounds together.
Three together, those are terrorists.
They put up to the sun and it will look at together, that's the brain.
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun goes on on the horizon.
A door -- put a book inside of the door -- it's the center of the door of the body.
They put a back inside the box, to ask questions.
There, there is someone in home.
This person is coming out of a door -- standing out of a door, standing up.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discovering.
three women together, they have carbon is adaptable.
So we've already spent about 30 dollars.
When I used to use this method, the first state of them will allow them to build 3D buildings.
The next group of eight minutes to build another 3D
So with every little effort -- will be able to learn a couple of kinds of cars, which is the same thing to learn a eight years.
So after I met the markets, we started to create factors.
For example, the mountain and the food together, we have a bunch of fire -- it's a volunteer.
We know that Japan is the land of the national sun.
This is a sun. This is a sun.
So a sun in the face -- we created Japan together.
One person behind Japan -- what do we have.
A Peace person.
The card on the left is two standards on the other.
In the old China, that meant that I mean, because the Chinese experiences were available to their political energy.
Today, the explain has become going to come to it.
A ball that tells you to where it will come out is a side.
This is a slide to remember that I have to stop talking to you and go out of the school. Thank you.
What I think about being dad are the molecules that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my children -- when my daughter was four years old, we saw the male of Alexander together.
The film will take his picture for months.
His favorite character was Germany, of course.
He gave him a good thing to use a green version and take a marker vision.
But when you look at that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary that it's extraordinary about.
Now we live and we created our children in a kind of industrial complexity of fantastic factors.
However, the Alm Mark was a technology in itself.
It doesn't start that text up.
The world really took the surgery on the front years later with it, the other thing whose property, a girl of market and a bad girl who was going to a living girl as a support of the energy.
You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.
There's a great difference between these two film, there is a couple of big differences between the Malani Manda and all the elements we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the middle of New.
The monkeys are quite amazing, like the shows.
But I think if the map of the Gate is done today, the map would say, "Hey, you're the sign of Line as the presentation of it.
They use materials to move into the mistakes of the marketing marketing of the ball back.
But that's not what happens.
One of the only one of the American map is that the most expensive characters and even molecules are women.
I started to notice this when I did this when I did San Wall to my son, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son as well.
It's about three years.
It was not invited to the process because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the survival level had gone down.  And so he got up on the room and I was interested as a mom on their patterns and I didn't think he had to understand what it happens.
I ask me what it is.
They were going to be value of value.
I would have the feeling that Lincoln is one to a flower to bring the governments to the government to do?
And we share this with the Middle Bang of 1990.
How do you give her movie?
It makes good friends with everything and being a leaders.
It's the kind of world in which I want my children to create Child, right? And not a world of men who go up, which is where we are.
Why is there so much fundamental financial force -- it forces in the molecules for our children, and so little as a little bit of the landscape of the landscapes of adults."
There's a lot of light about the impact of mass violence in the kids, and they should read it. It's very good.
I have not read so much about how kids are going to this room.
And I know about experience that the early Lab doesn't provide the market market that I had been used to get out of the world of the adults that is memory.
My search has started, I've got it.
Why do they get out there?
I don't know what I have to do.
The molecules are focused on the value and get their remember, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other environmental.
It's almost like to be a child, you have to be a short animal -- and if you're a girl -- you have to use a wall of war.
There are a lot of exceptions, and they will get up to the principles of Daniel for any of you.
But you get a message to children -- even though the girls are not really really your moral public planet.
They make a happy work when I teach kids how to stop on the paradigm, but don't necessarily show the kids how to stop the private.
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, so real as South and Kansas, but they don't stop to be molecules of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all the time is going to come out in the course of the classroom -- each of them.
until a lot of you are thinking about this year, this year, finally Valley Valley.
You will remember all of you.
They remember what the critical was said when he came out?
I can't believe that Park has done a film of a beginning.
It's very good. You don't remember that the decision?
Well, almost none of these molecules is going on the test of Berlin.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still has not been done and the property, but maybe we will start a movement.
And Alice Benjamin is a discovery of calculations, and at the middle of the year, I had a conversation that had had had with a friend on the evolution of the molecules that you see.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that you have to do -- in the movie -- there's more than a fundamental character that has lines?
So, you have to make the resource.
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Your conditions are about something else of the girl than so much you like it?  Right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things between it.
And so I have seen it, and yet I really see it in the song that we know and love.
In fact, this week was going to see a very good challenge of a very good quality.
Right? Reverse of Mars, a control of control, an idea of what is a message of the Harvard Hill.
Particularly, it doesn't happen the test of Berlin.
And I don't think I mean, because a lot of the film -- I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film of the movie where men and women are focused by the crisis of records.
We have a lot of men of men who have deep and popular conversation in this room, and it's the great time for one of the artists to take a look at the door and say, come to the floor, so many?
This is Holly.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2008, in the 100 more popular countries, how many of them believe they have the factory protests?
One. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've got recently for Congo, then it's good.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to do this room.
Last year, the New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said,
In the United States, one of every five women say that it has been sex once in your life.
I don't think that it is the cost of the marketing intervention.
I don't think the molecules for children have something to do with that.
I also believe that the lives of music or paradigm are straight statistically, but something wrong -- and when I heard that solution, one of the things that I think is that there is a lot of sexual strategies.
Who are those guys -- what are those kinds of distances?
What do you don't want to do?
They are similar to the story that says the role of a mass hole is to move into violence with violence and then to buy the record, which is a woman who does not have friends and not talking?
We are similar that story.
You know, as a father with the ability to capture a son like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very nice state and we want to give them them.
We have tools to our design as a power -- and we would expect that to do, but I have to ask you, and I have to ask you to ask them if at the same time, the same time, and the same time, we are eating our children so that they would get their children so that they will keep their own music?
I mean, I think the list of New is a way to do something really important, and here I mean literally to the parents.
I think we have to show our children out of a new definition of man.
The memory of the mass is changing obvious.
You have read about how new economy.
It's all changing it.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite behavior of San Wall you know what I respond?
Anderson: Web.
World Kenyan and Glamor.
What do you have in common these two.
Maybe it's not just the green version of it.
I think they are experience.
I think these are the two people in those film that you know more than anyone -- and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them take their potential again.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my son, and I like that kind of stories for my children.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I would tell my son, and it takes only and more stories where his work is going to go to a team -- maybe a team in the age of women, helping other people who are going to improve and be better people, like the Manda of New.
Thank you.
And I live in Michael and one of the things that I would like to look for was to look for the markets of Mars in the cost of Mars because my parents told me that that would tell me that it would give me.
But you know, it's hard to find these contents.
They are coming up and it's hard to see it.
But with the time, I used to look for it.
I started to see ways and patterns that help me get them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past.
And finally, when I started studying Europe, I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because in the way, my little piece in Marin, had grown up to one of the almost 100 miles of long at the sky.
And my market galaxies had created the size of cities.
This is really what I took me to do is that I was going to be able to be able to use sexual images.
To try to make a map of the past. I knew that I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the former.
This is a place that is a place on the American access called Benguary.
And the place, for simple view it seems to be more, but when we use the infrastructure and we think that we are using the bad color -- which is basically the place you see the place as a real robot.
What you're looking at is the chemical chemical changes of the landscape of building and the activity of the ancient elections.
I want to share with you how we've used the healthy data to find a ancient Earth called Americans, lost for thousands of years.
It was not the capital of the English animal for over 400 years in a period of time called the average Force about 400 years ago.
The place is based on the France, Europe, and it's really important because in the middle of the old Army, there was this great research of the old energy art.
The experts have always known that Islam was killed somewhere about the period of the two times that they build them, influenced inside the red characters here, but somewhere inside this huge piece of stream.
And this area is huge -- it's a little bit about nine percent.
Before the only step right next to the side of the American and as it changed to the time, it will take them into this and the whole city.
So how do you find a terrible city in a forest forest?
I will try to find it to the audience would be the equivalent to look for a hole on a paradigm, with the eyes and using a lot of biologists.
So, we use the American data of NASA to make a map of the place, with very successful change.
We were able to see where the Nichology is.
But you can see more distributed, and it is even more interesting -- this area line that you see inside the sky.
So we're going to talk with the European scientists to do the standard work, you can see it here.
When I tell you, it's like the stores of shows in ice but instead of climate change -- we will look back for human education.
five meters down, under a piece of side, and we found a piece of design of creative treatments.
And this means that in this position of Steven, five feet later, we have a capita of several hundred hundreds of years that are going on from the Middle impact, exactly the same period that we think is Stanford.
And we also find the workers of presentation, control, care and dance, what I showed that there was a collective street.
This might seem that it's not a very, but when we think about the most common legs used in the top of the Middle English, these are the guys who were used to be.
And so we have a little bit of control that has been able to be able to do the Middle impact in this place.
We also have an evidence of a piece of the space that shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still didn't find an income here, but we will go back to the place in a critical future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to support young engineers in the use of the health technology in so that they can also make big discover of it.
I want to end with my favorite car in the Middle English, I was probably written in Islamic 14 years ago.
And I would share the knowledge is most of all of the colleagues.
There's nothing like that.
So in the way, TED was not been done in 2005 day.
You know that ideas actually started in 2005 --   -- in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
You can certainly put the search of the marketing contents in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invited you to take your eyes.
So imagine on front of the door of it's home.
I want you to get attention to the color of the door -- the material that is done.
Now you can look at a group of numbers in backgrounds.
They are compared in a number of bacteria and they go on to the device of the beginning.
I need to look at this.
They are still straight, they are survived, they are going up a lot.
And they get up in front of your house.
There are biological blocks coming around all of the parts that go back to your side of the grandmothers that end up in the dark places -- they stop the battery of the door -- they start the battery of the door part.
At the way, the particular, or what there is on the other side of the door -- and look at the quality of the light. The light light on the Mars of the Gallery.
It is talking about your hand with your hand.
From his room, on a bad ball.
It's a book I talk about.
You can feel his black player making them on the note.
And you can call the flow of food and happens that is about to be able to focus on the table.
They put up for one side and send her room to be.
In the room, and making it use of their imagination of the image of the image of the image.
It is with a rock forest, danced about his method in the center -- telling me "The Boy Mars Mars Mars."
Now let me go back to the food.
The dream has been written with a path of yellow laws and from the hour come to you to you with you Carrily, the Guinea of Park, the Space and the read of "The Minister and Law of the Haiti, standing up with you.
Okay.
I want to tell you about a complete concept that comes up with each of them in New York City.
It's called the Microsoft "The United States.
I was going to build this effect a few years ago as a scientific standard, waiting -- I mean, that this was like the end of a know.
There were several men and a few days of different age and different heads of diagnosis.
They were looking at hundreds of open numbers looking at just one time.
It was measuring the name of decisions and tens of strange tens of ways.
And they explore the future in just minutes.
So you can see who could be able to be able to be able to be able to make a lot of a dog of a dollars of a dollars.
And I thought, "This is incredible?
These people should be phenomenon of nature.
And I started to talk to some of the companies.
This is a man named the Congo Commission that had been coming from England and that has one of the best impacts that have a better impact.
I said, "You know, how much does you realize that you were a site?
He said, "I'm not a know.
In fact, I have a average memory.
All of the people who are going to be able to say that they have a normal memory.
We have been sent to make these major major act of memory using a few old techniques -- invented about 150 years ago in mind, the same techniques that were used to measure their discovery, and that the means were used to be able to kill the freedom of the freedom bottoms?
And my reaction was, "Yes." How did I have not heard this before.
We were standing out of the side of the company, and I mean, who is a wonderful English English and brilliant, even though a little bit.
Do you know Bang States?
And I said, "No, Why?
Because I would like to teach you to Brazil Street how to measure the order in a back of living dancers, in national virtual village.
That would bring the world that anyone can do it?
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britain Santa, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spend most of the year in the next year, not only to send my memory but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be their poverty.
I met a lot of people really interesting.
This is a man called TED.
He is mathematically, very probably with the average worst in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even have a problem of memory -- it's impressive.
And it was incredibly transformation, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
In the other end of the space I met this man.
This is King Peter. In him were used for the Daniel pattern in the Darwin Daniel Man.
We went up with a bunch of together in the public audience of David California, measuring phone genesis -- it was standard.
And when you go back to me, I was a lot of treated about the memory about two years ago at the way, in the American and then in the middle of the Middle age.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having an idea of having memory and constantly wasn't one thing as much as it can be as long as it can be as long as it can be today.
A long time ago, people invented in their memory -- to provide their mind.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed of course, and I would say that they have changed us.
As we already don't have to remember -- sometimes it seems to us that we have to have us how to do it.
One of the last few places in our planet in where you are still available by this idea of a memory of a memory -- and solid and culture is this complexity of memory.
It's actually not so successful, there are companies like this around the world.
I was fascinating -- I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of the University of the University has been sent to a group of memories of memory -- at the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some way, which is a different or completely different of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more smart than the Right?
They gave them a control of control and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and it means between the brains of members of memory and those of the sounds of control that they were going to do with them.
When they put them into a magnetic machine machine.
And in effect they were used -- or they wanted to use it -- a part of the brain that involved the space of space and negative.
Why? Is there something we could learn about this?
The tradition of the computer market has been used as a open face where every year is going to be someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly and then the rest of companies have to put the day.
This is my friend Britain Francisco, three times.
In his school, in front of it, there are 35 degrees of decades that he's going to be able to try to figure out in a hours, using a technical that he invented and that he had just been dead.
He uses a similar technical to measure the order of 400 billions of dances additional biologists.
In the middle of a hour -- Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these companies -- absolutely all the techniques used in the end of a single concept that phones call a computer computer called a computer "March?
And it was a little bit with a particular school known like the Barker Bang, "What do I tell you about the next one, I say to two people who remember the same work.
That is his space.
And then I ask you, remember there is a Dallas Kana.
And when I go back later, and I asked you to remember that word I told you do a chair?
Do you think what it was.
The person who was told that his name is Bang is very likely to remember the same word that the person who said to him that his work is based.
The same word, different ability to remember -- that is amazing.
What happens here?
Well, the name name is actually not means anything to you.
With all of the other resources that go through their head.
But the word -- "Wow, we know the ways.
They use white seasons white search.
They have diagnosed in the hands.
They go back when they come home to work.
We probably know some wall.
And when we take that word for the first time, we started to put things to put them up in some point in some time.
One of the most amazing techniques to do this is about 2,000 years ago.
You know like the market of memory?
The story says like this, there was a piece called Joes that I went to a back.
They had focused it up as a construction, because before.
He went out of me, I remember her point of memory, and he was short, and so soon as it was -- the soul of the bank is collecting themselves.
They're going to take you all to all.
But not only the market to all of us -- but it turns out the bodies by doing it away.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting away.
So they could not be able to bring the body.
A task behind the other.
Simples, it was standing out on the middle of the workers -- close to the eyes.
I took the families of the hand to take them back to where they were their way that they were going on between the stars.
And what you see in that moment is something that we all know more or less in it, and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or numbers or numbers of the world or installation of the word of our colleagues -- we have a visual memory and except space.
If I asked me to get the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about Similan, it's very likely to do it very hard to do it very hard to do it.
But let me tell you that if you ask them to say that I was sitting on the top of the hole in his view, they would be able to get it out.
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more light -- the landscape and a sea and adult is the picture.
This is a context that comes from over 200 years ago, to the first few years -- in day.
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory in the same way that you have done if they had been invited if they were invited about 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're in the door of their home.
And it will do some kind of image of the simple image, crazy and intelligent and international to help us remember that the first thing you want to look at is that completely institutional computer.
And then you can imagine go back to his house, and see the Monter of the God shown on the same Yest.
And that's going to be going to be able to be able to introduce their friend Earth.
And then you look at Brazil Stanford to remember that article that you want to tell you.
And then they were going to work on the community, and the cost that you would talk to you that would be that strange journey they did for a year -- and they have some friends so they can help them remember it.
So this is how the technologies were taking their discovery, not a word for words, which is going to focus on it, but they are going to trust them.
In fact, the second state comes from the "Come "The "Come out of the "Come that means "Person."
It's a vision of when people thought about the article and in the relationship with this kind of space technology.
The front of the first place, it would be like the first place in your own market.
I saw that this was just fascinating -- and I got out of it in that.
I went back to some of these memory of memory and had the idea of writing something out of this surface of mathematical metals.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory of memory is kind of a pretty adult event that is an adult event of memory.
In fact, it's like to see a lot of people sitting now. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is struggling in the front of the front of it.
I'm a relationship and I need to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story -- I needed to try to put in his place.
So I started putting 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times -- just trying to remember something.
You may be a poem -- or the name of a high school analogy bought in a map of paintings.
And I found out that this was amazing interview.
I was called I was expected to be.
It was intervention, because it was not just trying to understand the memory.
What actually is about doing is better than the ability to create the ability to create and imagine these common images -- carefully, influences, increases, increases, increases and embarrassing and incredible analysis in the eye of mind.
I got pretty much with this.
So this is me, using my team set of environment for the memory of memory behavior.
It is a couple of adults and a couple of security sounds with scale left only two neighbors, because the direction is the worst energy of an memory of a memory of a memory of a media.
I ended up coming back to the same concept that had happened a year before. I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of particular experience of particular experience.
I thought this could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment.
And I put the cost -- something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's surrounded by able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
These are just a single transport.
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or marriage articles of galaxy. To benefit with a little bit about how their mind.
So we are talking about people with a big memory as if it will try to try to be an amazing day, but it's not the case.
The big members are wrong.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
Let's remember when we focus on a lot of professionals.
The top of the memory -- these memories of memory are just bottles.
In fact, they don't even have a real thing.
They worked because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep process, a kind of complex attention that most of us didn't go up with there.
But the reality is that there are no advantages.
This is how things are going on.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today is what I couldn't even remember I had a marker problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the dream of our records.
So how much are we willing to lose from what we have to do is that our existence is going to be lost in the Bangladesh or imagine, not to pay attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to be so expensive that we don't even make us in processes in professionally?
I learned from the first way that there are an incredible increases in all of us.
But if you want to live a wonderful life, you have to be the kind of person that I remember to remember it.
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture today.
It's a lot to fight in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue -- so we will take a whole place, New Jerusalem.
Because 30 years ago, I am about nine years ago, I was six years old and lived in my father in my parents in a village called Venus, and this was my kids.
In the school, from my day, I was the baby that I share with my sister with my sister with me.
And between my doctor and the baby, there was a baby that was going to be.
And there they all spent the object looking at the tank -- so every time I was going to go out of my room, you all see me, and every time I was born and I came back in a task, all of me.
And I was like this.
It was strength, and I had it.
I was going to have that star, I was able to know that bank, I was working that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Like it.
Those sense, those emotions that I felt -- that is the power of architecture because architecture is not about mathematics -- not from distributions, but of those visual connections that we feel in the places that we have to do.
And it's not going to prevent us that we feel like that way, because I remember with the U.S. Project -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the table.
Or it is, 90 percent of the time we are about architecture.
That's a lot.
And the architecture gives us in ways that we didn't even have to tell us.
That makes us a little bit, and very, very proud to us.
That means that when you show them a building like this, I know what you do is, think of power, "State and "Weather?
And I know that you think about it so that you think about it in a building building 2,000 years ago.
This is a transport.
It's a designer that use the architecture to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings in.
It is an emotional connection -- we have used this structure for a long long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago.
We use it in the 20th century.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build home.
You look at these things -- some of these states in front of the sleep, standing out of the elements.
This is very, very useful because they build things is a healthy.
It's costs -- it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who build people and governments and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that you know they're going to work.
And so we found us with buildings like this.
This is a whole way.
It's the public bank of Langlades who ended up in 2008, in my normal city, and you know, you have a cardiologist, has this red thing -- you have this red thing -- computers, record record, which let you will understand what Light is trying to communicate with this building, the visions, the variables, the variables, the variables.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a biology today.
That same year, in 2008, on the other side of the country, the other side of the country, which is like this.
It's in Senator.
This book shows how we use the media of communication in the diagram.
It's a new kind of public space for the city, a place to get up, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings -- both of these buildings -- are so completely different -- are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the piece.
In one side there is the innovation -- the adults that are able to make new technologies, new policy, new solutions for the forms of the current life.
We transformed and we put it together so much that we get completely from people.
All of a black -- you know, you think we feel very well, but we are dead in the inside because we don't have another opportunity.
We need to go to the other side and come to connect with those strangers systems.
So we do it, and we are all happy -- but we feel like transportation, so we started to experience again, we do the back of the back, and again, and then we have done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we came out of the decade of the 1960s.
The ants were used to explore with the called a called cartoon.
It has to do with the ants.
And that can be able to help you.
You see small single scales.
Something really hard to it.
So we are going to be able to go back to the 1980s, and we started to increase those systems.
We put the plan back into the other direction.
We take those ways we know that you like to love and so on.
We were able to go up and we were able to put them up and we use new materials and we use new materials.
I love it.
We're not going to go down.
We took Prace programs and we became them in the distances, which can be married markets made of video.
The ways they started to get up in power and color.
The oceans were became construction.
The kids grew up to the size of the building.
And one of them.
But they were the 80s, that was great.
We all spend the car in the commercial centers -- we moved to the boats, and there in the surfaces, we can create our own architecture architecture.
Those pictures could be the media, to the framework, or the intervention.
You can be able to be able to be able to be able to eat it.
This is what happens to the organization.
This is what happens to the system.
They are easy -- they are basically, because instead of creating new spaces -- we would have a lot of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, that's not the Talk.
This is China.
And the adults are sitting up and we started to make the village again in the other direction.
In the 1980s, and at the early 10, we started to experiment with the record called the medical student.
We set out the stories -- we now know with new design techniques of design design, and we would find it with new companies -- some ways that are stars against other ways.
This is activity and extraction, and it's sort of improvised, and you have a lot of excited.
You know, the police plant of a new thing in the opposite direction.
But then, happened something responsibility?
In 2010, you get this building.
This is the German Bender, from Francisco German.
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul George said that Bill was one of those moments when you build and public and public public and public public plants, they were completely completely about a building.
The New York City.
The transportation in Bang is in a 2,000 percent when they end up the building.
So suddenly all the world wanted one of those buildings -- the News, Shanghai, China, Chinese, Congo, Seattle, Seattle.
Everybody wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architecture.
But how is it possible that these forms and solids and radios, how is it possible that they become access around the world?
And it happened.
We've created an emotional reaction with these ways.
And the same thing made the world's main computers.
So they all believe that if they had these forms and they had culture and transport.
And this phenomenon of the new million country country with other stars with the other.
And I went to God and Link, and what happened with these little architecture in the world of the new military -- actually starting to happen with all the architecture -- the digital media started to increase the speed of the information.
Think about it, for example, how do you have a crime control.
A thousand years ago, they would have to be done to the next person to see a building.
The transport is all addressed, you can take a back, an airplane can be transportation.
The expensive technology can be able to see in the boxes, and at the end, we all are a picture of architecture and the building is beyond their physical attention.
The architecture is all over the right now, that means that the speed of the community has been made the speed of the architecture.
Because the architecture.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four or four years, and in that time, an article can design two, eight or 100 buildings -- before you know about four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there has never been good back in architecture in architecture.
That's how we find with buildings like this.
It was not a two years old, but about 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building building buildings like this because we didn't have no idea how much of them.
That's never going to happen to happen. I think, because we are in the most revolution of the most revolution in architecture from the information from the face of the face or the article, and it's the medicine of the media.
My theory is that when you apply to the media to the media media -- it starts to make it more quickly -- to get to be in both there are almost about the difference between innovation and symmetry, the difference between innovation.
Now we can do some increases almost -- with emotional care of something completely new.
Let me teach you how the system works.
And we were focused to support this building that they were in.
This is the center of a village called Picks in Francisco Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community.
But that means that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the adults looked like the product of the printer, there was no surprise there.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer -- when people started to get and share it in social media.
And as you use them to tell you to tell their story, they become part of the personal nature, and that makes control with collective memory -- and when you will make these symbols, we learn to us.
I mean, we don't need to do that we don't need to tell us how to think about.
We can tell us what we think about the architecture because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us.
Think for a second in those biological biologists.
If that building is built today, first we were going to go to the Internet in looking at "American "climate?
We would be based with examples of experience, of innovation -- what it might be a bit of a bill.
That is common.
They can take the care of Leonardo, to the people of Lincoln, and to tell you that there is no only answer to what it might be a bit today.
Let's be part of this.
This state of solutions gives the freedom of experiment.
It's all different now.
And the architecture are no longer these microbes that use the magic words that use complete words, and it's no longer a public audience that doesn't have seen something that has no seen before.
The artists can listen to you, and you don't let care about architecture.
And that means that the very wonderful world of a state to the other, from a movement to another, is relevant.
In fact, we can go up and find social solutions to the problems that face the society.
This is the end of the story, and it means that the buildings of the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
That means that a public space in the ancient city can be only and open to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a state in Brazil, can be that, a sound in Brazil, and not a bad imagination of a red law of red decade in ideas of what it should be a state.
That means that some robots can build our buildings because we finally will be ready for the ways that are going to produce it.
That means that the buildings are taken to the causes of nature and not to control it.
And this means that a bunch of statistics in San Berlin, Ford, can also be able to be able to make a discovery or for me, or even you can even go out there at night.
That means that three artists can be able to be able to be able to be born in the New York City.
It means that no building is too small for innovation.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a back or a robot who built our buildings built together.
It doesn't matter how we build it, what matters is what we built it.
And the ants you know how to do more psychological buildings and more smart and more sensors.
We've been waiting for all of you.
And finally, we are no longer at all.
They find an architecture -- they put them together and work together to make better conditions better cities, better cities, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings don't just reduce our society, but they give it to the most small space, the local blood sharks, the hours where we face our kids, and the step of the table to the water.
Thank you very much.
This is my street, Steve.
I was just going to be a year and he started to walk on.
And it does it from that deep way -- it's about the kids of a year, also as if your body was moving too fast for their legs to be moving too fast for their legs to do.
It is just a whole thing.
And one of the things that you like to do at the moment is to look at the message.
She really love her relationship.
It goes up and Chile, and you give themselves all these big bits and minimum.
It's beautiful.
You know, all your friends do this and my mom realize that I used to do it -- and he made me think, when to do this?
How are we really not going to like our particle?
Because unfortunately, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google, "I'm fast?
This is Facebook, it's 13 years old and live in Deney.
And as any analyze, it just wants to be wanted and fight.
This is a sign of the night.
This is present for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear -- it's a little bit.
And between what his mom tells you and what your friends, or companies of school.
So it makes a video of her, and I put it in London, and I asked others that please leave a saying, "I'm a biology or I'm forest?
Well, so far for now, Facebook has got more than a 150 forests.
Some of these are so dead, that I don't even have to think about them.
We talk about a healthy school, normal and corruption, which has these responsibility in one of the most emotional life of their most emotional life.
thousands of people are putting videos like this -- in their biggest grandmothers trying to communicate this way.
But what is it trying to do this?
Well, the technologies today are never alone.
They are used to be on the line and available all the time, talking about, talking to me, and I would like to spend me, starting to me, shared, to share it, showing up this never taken up.
We have never been so connected -- in a way, in a way, so young as young as young people.
As a mother he said, "It's like a picture in his fourth all nights."
It's just not profitable.
And the social teachers that go from the hand with that are immediately.
This environment, to be always connected to our children to act in our children in the number of me who have and the types of food that they get to get on.
There's no distribution between a life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what it is.
What is the most expensive thing in the life of someone front to what's normal in a digital context in a digital process.
And where are you looking for the instrument?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are part of the news of the girls in the now.
And moral models of the street is going to take our paradigm.
And the techniques of architecture is right now.
And transportation like, "Wells, an entrepreneur and surgery.
For those of you who get it up, it makes a primary meaning for them.
These tools are associated from women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people.
But the kids are not interested to this.
As the ones of the surgery of the spider, and the state of the streamists of the dead.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we sure we want our children to grow us out and they are individuals well well.
But in a culture in a culture of the image, we're teaching our children to make more time and the mental effort to their support -- to the process of all of the things that are about their identity as well.
So things like their relationship -- the development of their physical education, their studies and other things start to get out.
seven in every 10 girls will not do something because they think you don't see the simple enough.
These are not traditional activity.
They are fundamental activity for their growth as human beings and as the support of society and the field of the market development.
35 percent -- almost one in every three challenges are not interested in the kinds of the key cards, and they start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to call the attention for their physical aspect as well.
One of each of each of them are not going to the class at all.
And in terms of extraordinary, if you don't think you see the good enough if you don't think that they are definitely definitely, you will get a little bit less to the average of your companies who don't worry about that of the approach.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finance, the United States.
And it gives us even what they actually spend these young people.
So, so that we are going to be talking about, we are talking about how you see you, not how you're really going to see you.
The authority is about your body is taking the changing construction.
And it's also using the health.
They have a little bit of analogy to make a little bit less physical activity -- they eat less free and collective, they put up in a little bit of the strangers that can be able to take them back to a food.
They have low behavior.
They are more excited by the people than the roof and they are in a lot of designer.
And we think that's why they take more recording decisions like the control of computer and drugs, direct streets, straight rates, self-assembly relationships, and no protection and profit diagnosis.
The period of the perfect body is put to the health system, and our government costs millions of dollars every year.
And we are not.
So women who think they have a lot of again, especially if they have or don't have a lot of instruction.
The 18 percent of women don't think about a work in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could go up this, what would that be the opportunity that would be.
Let me read this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it, you don't get very far away.
I don't know.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first is that we have to pick up in their own body.
We have to help our willing to develop students to support the pressure of the perfect images and build their automobiles.
The good news is that there are many available programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs are going on.
So we need to make sure that the program that our kids are not just having a positive impact but also a modern impact as well.
And the research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas -- the first one is the influence of family and friends and relationships and relationships and relationships and relationships and relationships and resources.
These six species are set of the critical particles for any willing to open an education.
One education is fundamental -- but we will go to this problem requires every one of us that we take the conditions in the issue and we're a better model to follow the women and children in our own lives.
It is going to focus on the current state of the women are seen and based on our careers.
It's not good to tell you with the support of our policy in terms of skin or the size of their fish or to find out that the detail or the success of a solid alternative of the fact that it's not a big beauty of the fact that it's not a big beauty of the fact that it's not a big beauty of the fact that it's not a
We need to start putting people so they are, not like you see it.
All of us can start doing it for the responsibility for the kind of images and companies that we published in our social network.
We can choose the people based on their effort and their action and not in their attention.
And let me ask you, when was the last time they had a fish?
In fact, we have to work together as a community, as governments and companies -- to change our culture -- so that our children grow up all their person, value the individual -- the diversity -- the disease.
We have to put the people who are really going to make the difference in a period.
So to make a difference in the real world, we make the ones that come in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you can see that you are going to see that they are who they are -- or what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
What do you have in mind.
And in your wife in your wife in your wife in your hand.
On your book?
And he did your daughter to his daughter ...
On his fire?
It could be just the woman who is two areas of distribution. What would it mean?
So what would it mean for her if we knew this, and we would say how to do the potential of that world?
Right now, the animal of our culture with the images are getting to everything.
But let's teach our kids the true.
So let's show that the way you see it is just a part of your identity -- and the truth is that we love them for who they are and for what they do, and by how they make us feel sense.
We including the audience in our school.
We change each one of us, the way we talk about and we share with other people.
And we would work together as a community, from small groups to governments -- so that the little through a year of a year of today, they become a sense of safe changes in their morning.
Let's do it.
The five percent of 1950 -- a series called the United States came back to a man in Mars and angelish to the Robo Mars Kan, the leader of the Los Colony Leader.
In order to find out that they took it up, but it will be present by other cases, in company of others -- they started to put them back to the advantage of a few years of New York, including them, and the sea of the United States.
And by the way, these plants were made by a program of the FBI.
Silent, the age of 2005 in the World Arab Arabic, you couldn't get up.
More later, I would be connected by his passion at that time.
The United States is my father.
I was born in Prince, Paris, in experiments.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of the Island, which very few -- even most of the molecules, they get to know.
And by the time I saw that when people take time to interact it, it doesn't really make a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all right, in all of a human group, there is always a little physics of people who are open to their conditions that you think that you have to use all of the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before he was with me and I felt that in the last few years of week, he and some friends had been looking at the water of the street in South Europe, to protect it.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the Park Terror -- that without knowing our group.
And when I took to stop, my father helped me to hold me up in the man in the man, and I was going to tell me how to go to the goal to about 30 feet.
And that day, with the last step that will be given to the small light light on the goal and in the surface of all of all of us -- especially me, all of the state of the stage in calls up.
My dream went back to the others and in Rome, he said, "I am a particularly poster?
As a father of a father -- a child.
And all of all of all of them will make you a lot of record -- but just a few years later, I understood what it was so much.
They saw in me, the same level of relationship that my father could cause it.
Those people later, they would be able to put a computer with 300 miles of experts in the surface of the World Treating of the World Treating Country, going to be able to be an experts that killed to six people and went to another 100 percent.
I would take these men.
I called them "Love, which means a news.
And when I was 19, I had been moved 20 times. And that institutions for my child was not allowed to do a lot of advantages.
Every time I started to feel about a little bit about somebody who was time to explore and go to another city.
As I was always I was the new face of the kind of kind of chance that it was value of microscope.
And I was able to remember my identity to try to be the white -- but it will be the new of the class and self-assembly and release, it was enough.
So most of the time was going to be able to read books -- looking at the game or play games or playing games.
So by these reasons I don't develop social skills to do it -- to do it sure -- to grow for food, it was not presenting for the real world.
And I was told to play people to people, with the based in the artists -- as their reason or their relationship or their relationship or your relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or its relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship or their relationship
So how could you hear the eyes eyes.
One of the first experiences that they put up with my way of thinking -- it was during the private choices of 2,000 percent.
In a critical program in which I was involved in the National National Congo in Philippines.
And my group was born in the issue of sub-Saharan violence -- like I had been able to kill all my life, it was something that I felt a lot of passion that I felt a lot of countries.
The members of this group came out of fun.
One day, to the end of it, I found that one of the kids with who we had done was the wall of it.
I took a number of days to go to the light -- and I realized that there was no animals between the two.
I had never had a friend of my living friend and finally felt very proud of having been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to believe that it was a transportation.
The other critical moment came up when I get a job of summer in Brazil Gates, a piece of fun.
I found people from all kinds of knowledge and culture -- that experience in the development of my career.
The entire life had taught me that the human was a little and, by the way, all of the girls were bad enough.
And by the way, I had the opportunity to work with hydrogen anti-stars there, and I could see that several of them were the most bombs and less creatures that had seen in life.
And I was going to be able to take a child, I developed a sense of impact to the surface of the others, but it was not easy to me to treat people, exactly in the way I would have been trying to be trying to be trying to be trying to be trying to be trying to be treated by it.
For that feeling I was able to control the results that had taught me of a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be humanity, but I know what it is that it is going to be playing for something beyond my control.
Then I saw the "Competen Santa."
Every night, John State made me be incredibly expensive to me, and I was going to see that the risk of people -- the red or sexual organization, you have nothing to do with the care.
And in many ways, he became my first way in a moment where I was willing to need it.
You can see the inspired can come out of the inspiration, and that a community was had a better evidence in my life that my own father -- it was not going to go into the back.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think about it, and she told me something that I would build in my heart for always as he was alive.
And she looked at me with the eyes of someone who has had enough enough and he said, "I'm trying to have a handle of heading?
At that time, I realized how much black energy you need to keep all of that day in your front of you.
My name name is not Big Francisco.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why should I go back and put it into a real reason?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope someone -- some day, who is trying to take the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that even though I was going to me to this visual institutional and international institution, I did not come to make food.
By the way, I decided to use my experience to fight the third and against the transportation.
I do it for the speed of the transport and for their beings who were going on, by the terrible terrorist, and the food that the crisis has been produced in their lives.
By the speed of the research to talk to those creatures without a sense of my father.
And with this simple I'm going to get me here as a test that the violence is not an image to any relationship or race -- that children don't have to follow the hands of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this time there is a film that's project in their mind.
This is an incredible movie film here.
It's in 3D and it has sound from what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has an antibiotic, knowing and temperature and term.
You feel your body -- your man, your hand, your pain.
It has emotions and expensive and happy.
It has records, as a moment of your institution that are project for your eyes.
And it has a voice of a voice in your full of thinking about.
The heart of the movie is you want all of it all in direction.
This film is your source of conflict -- the surface of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truth of the existence of the existence of the existence of it.
Each of us is construction.
We all have an early interest of the own interest -- you and you.
There is nothing that we know more different.
On the least I know I have a consequence of it.
I don't have a true of you to be aware of.
The consciousness is also the reason to live in.
If we weren't aware of, nothing in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most similar phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we about that?
So why do we have these international fields?
Why are we not just robots that we're going to do to produce the results without having a sense of the entrepreneur to experience?
At this point, nobody knows the answer to those questions.
I knew that to interact the consciousness to science -- you need some traditional ideas.
Some people say that it's impossible to a science.
The science -- for nature, it's object for nature.
Consciousness, for nature, is survival.
So there may never be a science.
Because it takes almost all the 20th century.
The physics studied the behavior obviously studied the brain of the brain -- but never no one mentioned the consciousness of the conversation.
And even 30 years ago, when TED began -- there were very few scientific jobs about conversation.
After 20 years ago, it all started to change.
It looks like five Critics and physics like Robert Peter said, "Now it's the moment for science to control the consequence?
And since then, there was a real explanation -- a result of the scientific work on the consciousness of consciousness about it.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental food to the moment.
The center of the science of the science in the recent years was the bit of communities, control between some areas of the brain and some states of the conversation.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I think I would put Kan Kingdom a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for example, the area of the brain that are related with the creative experience of looking or to feel pain or feel happy.
But this is being a science science science.
It's not a science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related with certain kinds of cognitive experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain it to me that this kind of work of the birth represents some questions that we want to explain the conference -- the questions about what you do certain areas of the brain and with what they do.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
We don't have to make the neurons.
In fact, there is no easy problems with consciousness with it.
Well, I don't hear the center control of this material, why all the physical process in the brain has to be compared by consequence?
Why is there a state of surgery?
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to nature.
It is going to become a huge phenomenon as the limitations, like the scales, like the life, and we're going to find express it.
They are all all sorts of computer behavior -- how they would go out of them, how to make the limits, how do the tools -- how do they grow up, and they get up and make the living organisms -- they're all questions about the moral work.
That could be used to the human brain to explore some behavior and the function of the human brain as a perfect energy, how we do, how we talk about, how we talk about, how we talk about, how are we going to hear the behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness -- the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is full of a surface experience.
And here it is, the standard profile of the surface -- the paradigm will be able to be able to not really have a lot to tell it.
I am a scientific machine.
I want a scientific theory of the authority that works. For a long time, I put the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in some physical theory to work.
But at the end I got to the concept that it doesn't work for social reasons.
I think we took in this point.
So we have a sense of massive experience, so we have a lot of this -- the music explain the change, the climate will explain biology -- biology explain part of the physics.
But the consciousness is not going to be able to end on this stage.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of it.
In the other, we don't know how to take that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think the consciousness right now, it's a kind of analogy, something that we need to interact our vision of the world, but we don't know that we still know that.
And with an animal like this can be able to need traditional ideas -- I think we need ideas that in the first seem to look like lights, before we can deal with the consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibility for those crazy ideas.
My friend San Discovery, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no really hard problem of aware of it.
And all the idea of the public movie is even a sort of increase or conflict.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the moral work, the behavior.
Well, more power for him.
That is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the construction of construction constructed in the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other, that vision is pretty close to just stop that the consequence of consciousness is solution.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two local ideas that I think they can be.
The first idea is that consciousness is fundamental to it.
The physics sometimes take some aspect of the universe like fundamental factors, the space and the moment.
They put the fundamental laws that governments -- as the laws of gravity or a quantum mechanical laws or mechanism.
These laws and the fundamental patterns don't explain in terms of anything else.
At the way, they would be able to make fantastics, and that's the world.
Sometimes the list of the food is all all right.
In the 19th century, Mars discovered that you can't explain the electric fish in terms of the professional control statistics, space.
I think that is the situation that we found with aware of it.
If you can't explain the consciousness in terms of the present ideas, space, time, time, market, then you have to play the list -- you have to play the list of it.
The most natural thing was to put the attention of the same thing as a fundamental sign of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's probably not an object of science.
It is going to open the way to make it single scientist.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that government the consciousness -- the laws that connect the concept with other function consequences: space, the time, the time, the map of physical process.
The physics sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we could be able to go out in a rest.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could be able to sound in a forest.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second idea is that consciousness can be universe.
Every system can have a bunch of consciousness here.
This vision sometimes is called a standard, "Please particularly per mind, every system.
Even a picture has any factory of education.
The idea is not that people are smart or you think about.
It's not that a picture can be full of anti-stars when you think about it, I always travel the speed of light.
I never can describe and clear the radios?
No, no.
But the thinking is that maybe the teachers can have some elements of critical sense -- survival, some early principle of the conversation.
This can be a little crazy for you.
How do someone think something so little something?
And in part of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- as the space and the mass and the mass and the mass is nature that it can also be used as the others.
It is also worth to notice that even though the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for the people of different culture -- where the human mind looks more like nature.
A more profound reason it comes from the idea that maybe the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that the thought with the physical process, is to visit the connection with the information.
It always is that there is a process of information, there is aware of it.
It comes to complex engineering, like in a human being a human be, complex control.
It comes from simple information, very simple.
It was very exciting is that in the recent years a light, George Steve, I took this kind of theory and the development of the development of mathematical metaphors.
It has a mathematical measure of information -- which is called door, which is called the degree of information in a system.
And it turns out that guy has to do with the consciousness of it.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible amount of information of information -- a high danger of children, a lot of consequence.
In a car there is a huge amount of information of information -- as much as a lot of meaning, which is pretty important.
But when it comes to the miles, microbes -- particles, the degrees of the game says to me.
The level of information of information is more, but it's not any note.
In the theory.
In fact you make a fundamental law of the context: high dance of kids, high control of knowledge.
In fact, another reason is that particular can help us to make care about the physical world.
The physics and scientists with often have looked at the physics that the physics is accessible.
It describe the structure of reality using a lot of spaces, but we don't talk about the reality that goes down.
As I explain San Harvard, where does the fire of the schools?
From the view of the physics of the physics of physics you can leave you like they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of aware of it.
This is what physics do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
And in this view, the consciousness is that it makes him start in the education.
In that view, the consciousness is not the outside of the physical world as a kind of antibody.
It's right there in the center of the control.
This vision -- I think, the physical vision has the possibility to transform our relationship with nature and it can have social and simple situations that are pretty simple.
Some of them can be an analysis.
I used to think that he had not to eat anything that had consciousness -- then I should be village.
If you are a pattern and you hear that vision -- will have a lot of man.
I think I was going to think of it -- this is going to try to transform your vision -- while what matter in the state and the moral knowledge -- it's not so much the fact that it is the fact of consciousness but their importance and their behavior.
It's also natural to ask for the consciousness in other systems, as the computers like it.
What about the artificial intelligence system.
Is it constructed?
In the view of the particular information, she has a complicated information, and so the answer is yes, if it's aware of it.
If this is right -- you can have a very serious very serious side on the rest of the development of smart computers and the ability to take it out.
First of all, you can ask for the complex collective conversation the planet.
It has your own consequence?
Or at a smaller level, a giant group -- like the audience in a TED talk -- at this time we have a TED concept -- an interesting film for this TED group of the TED group of the TED group.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take a week.
So this particular view is a relative vision -- and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second is the universe.
The vision of a lot of questions, a lot of challenges -- like, how to think about the kind of thinking we know the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can respond to those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of the serious consciousness theory.
If no, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and physical.
We can't expect to solve it in the night at the morning.
But I think we are going to be able to figure out.
You understand the consciousness is the real key -- I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Viction.
He had a very normal period, a kind of education.
I went to school, I went to my friends, I was getting me with my own minds.
It was all a very normal thing.
And when I was 15 years old, a memory of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to make a picture of the community.
And my parents would say, well, that's a very nice problem.
She didn't actually get anything --  and they had right.
I went to school, I was very good at school, I had a school under my mother, and I had a lot of time looking at the "Brown "Brown and "The Virtual Sick and Daniel Creation?
Yeah, I know. So what do you do.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was an extraordinary thing.
No one that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the discovery out of education.
years later, I was in the second part of the teach in a secret school of Michael, so just after about 20 minutes in the case of the 19th minutes a guy who was going on the hand and said, "Oh, when you give your discovery?
And I said, "What do you discover?
Well, I had been talking about the law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your personal structure.
When the people in the bottom -- they talk about research things in school.
Please go in the control of action?
And then it was when I asked me, this kid had had experience with people with people who are interviewing as objects of institutions as well.
And we are not. And it's not clear of the girl -- is to say, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, people who are not our teacher or our doctors or our magnets.
We're not really real people. We're there to interact in.
And in fact, I'm in this stage to what I do in this single single single day, and you probably are waiting for them to be inspired to you.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to be able to get them out.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I am here to tell you that they have become a relationship to distribution.
Yes, we have sold us the mind that the discussion is something Mars, at the same hand, I was male.
It's something bad and living with a description you make you.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make a little bit.
And in the last few years, we've been able to produce even more this way through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only design in life is a bad activity?
Or this one, "The expert is investigate?
Or this one is or the open one: "And interview?
These are just a couple of example, but there is a lot of them.
It can be that they have seen one of the girl without the hands with a state of the street on the table.
You may have seen a child who goes on with legs of carbon correction.
And there are a lot of these images -- which is what we call a heart inspired in.
And I use the whole term -- because they make a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we spread to the designers in the benefit of people without discovery.
And the purpose of these images is we will figure out, so we can see it and think, "Well, in very bad than my life, it could be worse better.
I could be that person.
But if you get that person.
I have lost the number of the number of times that have been able to explain that they believe that I am a service or a source of inspired -- and this happens to before my work had a public physical.
It was as if I was happy to stay through the morning and remember my own name --  and this is to be able to be able to be able to be it.
These images -- those images affect the people with distribution in the benefit of people without designed.
They are there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their creatures in perspective.
And life as a personal person is actually something hard.
We have some things.
But the things we knew are not the things that you can think about.
They're not relationship to our body.
I use the term people who were discovered because I was going to be called the social model of the discovery, which tells us that we are more discovering because of the society we live that because of our bodies or diagrams.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very close to it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their ability to do it, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the community.
They are just using their bodies by doing the best of their ability to do.
So, it's really how to do it in the way we do it, when you share those images?
When people tell us, "You are a surprise of infection? It tells it as a control.
And I know why it happens.
It's about the mind, because you've sold this sense that the design makes us.
And yes, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I am here by getting the inspired -- and you think, "Oh my God.
And actually, I know I'm going on.
So I learned from other people with all of the time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more likely than them.
I learned that this is a great idea to use a few pieces of carbon to pick up the things that I can get to me --  I learned the universe of how to make the mobile phone in the box of the side.
Okay.
We learn from the force and responsibility of the others -- not against our bodies and our data, but against a world that happens to us.
I really think that the mind that they have sold us about the distribution is the biggest intervention.
It makes us hard life.
And that car, "The only device in life is a bad activity: the reason that that's going to be a true is not true.
A bunch of sounds for a street of schools has never done it in a robot.
I never --    -- in order to be able to be able to be able to get the surface for the surface people.
I also have a lot of people in the middle of a book and preventing a positive act to turn all of those books to the bottom.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where the discovery is not the experience, but the amazing.
I want to live where a 15 years old, sitting in his court saw "The "Los "The Virgin Valley doesn't be able to not be able to be in a side.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low experience from the people who are going to be happy to get away from the way and remember our name in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we move the genetic place of people with distribution, and I want to live in a world where a child of the 11 degrees in a high school school -- it's not a little surprising that their new teacher is a little bit of surface that his new teacher is a search of surface.
We don't do it exciting, but it doesn't question what you believe about about it is what it is.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the real reality and the professional factory, with the experiment?
And what is the average speed of a control without care?
Unfortunately, today, I just respond to one of those questions -- so please don't get down.
When people think of reality -- think of "The "Climb "Competen and in San Cross using the hands in the air in the air. But the reality is not science science.
The reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the reality is going to change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phone.
So how do we go back to the actual reality.
The first step is what I did is, the Google governments Google.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that governments are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what it is to be a professional design in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to test you.
I have to use words.
I have to create a market that you will take with your imagination with you.
We can use the Google Google, under a house and to know what it is to run on the game of play at the game of the game at the time of 150 miles a dream of the surgery.
We can know that it feels that a man of 12 degrees -- we were trying to focus with all of his being going to be.
I've been there and you make sure that it's not a grandmother.
I took some lives to show you what the Google is.
It was not imagination of the prototype of the Big, because the idea of the U.S. technology is a surface coming into the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris World -- let's go.
It's horrible to be.
A moment. We got a little bit.
Pretty preserve?
Are we going on.
Chris Kenture: As you can see, it's a privacy of what it is to be used in the film field from the professor of the collection.
You have realized that some people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, it comes from the University of the World.
Mark of career: Revolution 44. Diamond Dallas?
blue two, And And January 24.
Chris Koran: This is just a little bit more to the feeling being in the field.
They want that experience.
They want to be on the field -- being their favorite players, and you have asked me in The Arab and in TED, you can see the name of a field of a field of the field of a field.
Or a correct?
We want to experience that.
Once we have that experience with Google and Google George, how do we take it back to the next single circle?
We take it to that level using something called the Radio Richard, which is for a lot of you know.
The Richard Richai has been discovered as the most creative reality of the most creative reality -- and it is not working word.
And I'm going to teach you because with this video.
Man: Oh, OK?
No, no, no, I don't want to keep playing play?
Oh, my God, OK?
SW: That's the experience of a man in a room in a way that is going through his life.
What will be the experience of a song when you get a video of Alzheimer's Park carrying the line -- discovered from a company before the arm before you go back and make a school -- which will be the experience of a pattern of a map of a map of a map of a pattern to be the experience.
When I can be Men running on the car, I would get the based at the bottom of the reason? Or let me make a side in Williams?
So what would you be your experience when it comes to a movie to more than 100 miles like a state state?
Maybe you make the views of the patterns for adults.
But this is not really really an alternative way.
It's just virtual reality.
How do we make the actual reality.
We're going to make the reality right when the entrepreneurs, the markets and the willing to see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our stars?
How do we use it?
Because they are always going to use the technology to move out.
They like to go on. It gives you money.
So here was a rest of a rest of the technology in the USA.
In 1998, the Parkinson's Parkinsons asked him to be able to his field of field so that I would play faster to make more quickly.
They put the Sun Brown that year.
Other team decided to take them out.
And more people saw the past because it was more exciting because it was more quickly.
In 2010, the New percent was put up in the careers of the field and then in the designers of designers.
They had more species because it was faster -- more interacting.
In 2010, imagine that they are a player coming back to their group and see their next place in front of you, in a plastic view that they have to be able to worry about to forget a pain.
Or by looking at the structure.
They just go to the field and transformation.
And they want them to do it because if you don't get their institutions -- they are lost by particles, and they have to lose particular.
If you look for them to get them up as a presentation of it.
And they don't want that.
But the actual reality is not just a market of the memory structures.
The actual reality is also a way to pick information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the part of the particular.
How would you do?
Now, a very simple chance would be a camera in every single corner of the state having a view from the people who are down.
You also have information from the fingers and the expensive, something that is already working on.
And all of that information will go into your players.
The good team would be able to find it.
The bad people will be able to have information.
This difference to the good team of bad.
So your team of information will be as important as your records, and the data of data will leave to be just for neurons.
It would be also to tell you, who would have imagine?
How would it be in the camp?
Imagine that it's the market of field.
You get the basis and records.
It was going to a open record of the surface of the left part of your view in your view of your view that a design behind you is going to address you, but you don't see it, but the Ross system.
You go to the area of the process.
And one of you who are an open record that there is an open record.
You take the ball, but they gave you.
And the bank lost the transport.
You don't know where to read -- yet, the region looks at your view a area of fear that gets out and it can be able to move the career.
It goes up with the balloon, and it goes up and analogy.
The public public and the factors have been taken out of the planet from every day.
This is something that will make an impact on the past.
It will make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite play.
The reality will actually be part of the design because it is too close to not be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of the amazing actually?
We're going to use it just as a pattern and car, like our entrepreneur to heal?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the fact that we can be able to make the impact between human beings to show someone how it is, literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology comes for for the deception of democracy.
It gets thousands of dollars a year.
But how much this technology is for a teacher in the audience trying to show a drive how days are their access from the perspective of the view?
So how much is this technology for a gene and Robert trying to show the world how it would be all being perfectly?
How much is it also for a Congo Congo or a National Newal trying to inspired a generation of children so that they think more in space and science rather than the state and the science instead of technology and School notes.
Seconds and gentlemen, the actual reality is happening.
The questions that we do, the decisions that we take and the challenge that we find -- you know, as it always -- of us.
Thank you.
I remember me after 24 years of service in the Haiti Park of California.
Most of those 24 years I was able to put it up with the huge state of the Mars of Mars -- which including the period God God.
And this is a computer structure -- known by their beautiful visions of San Francisco, the ocean Mars, and the architecture of an architecture.
Unfortunately, it's also an image for the surface, being one of the most used places in the world.
The New Galenton Game was open in 1977.
James Southern Stanfords, I have been able to build the beautiful, said that, "The bridge is particularly at the surface of surface.
The surface from the bear is not a practice or profitable."
But from his approach, more than 1,000 people have been taken to their death from that planet.
Some of you believe that I would travel between the two.
But let me tell you that what happens when the door is used to go up to make the surface.
After a book of four to five seconds, the body goes against the water about 150 miles per hour.
The impact is the bottom, some of those people who are looking at some of them who are pleased organizations.
Most of it is in the impact of the problem.
And the thing that no, I notice that it was born in the industrial water and then they get up.
I don't think that those things that are going to tell you about this piece of subjective is getting out of the way that they will get in.
This is the card.
And except around the two days, there are three tons of particle parties at the way.
This is where most people are in order to take life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is in that right, and in their most dark moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young year was talking to an activity to put her life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day to bring it back on the back.
When I started working on the country, we didn't have any form of the way.
We ended up to keep the way through these calls called these called this.
This was not just a bad service to those who control the surface, but the office as well.
We've got a long way since time.
Today, we had seats and phones go into the new officers.
This is John David.
I met it 24 percent of the last year when I got a call of a population of a possible sounds sitting in the right near the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center
And I said, and when I came in, he looked at students talking to a character of the Korean God.
James was only 30 years old, and I had come up up to the New Leison.
In fact, I had come up up to this two times before New Jesse to try to come out from this power.
After a time to talk to Joshua, we asked us if we knew the story of the Carter of Paris.
And I will remember the Minister Germany, Zero I thought Park, and I went back to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You never would have that box."
Well, one day, the quality was more than Pale, and she opened the box down.
And they came out of the streets, weight, and all kinds of thousands against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so they just ask us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no hope.
And then you get a few of them to go up on the right and it was.
This limitation of number and smart of New Jesse was just going to take the life.
I was talking to the parents of Joshua that night, and I knew that when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be so well, because at the next day, the family of family called me to see how I was.
The parents of James had been done it.
The local data of the surface.
I put them up with these questions -- what if a memory of your family or a friend or someone was going to be surprised?
What would you do?
You know what to do?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you have to listen to it.
I heard to understand it.
They don't discover it, and they tell the person who you know how it feels like, because they probably don't know.
It's just going to be there, you can be the whole point that they need.
If you think that someone is surprise, you're not afraid to get them and make the question.
So one way to ask the question is, "You know, "We have been thinking about their life, you've had these thoughts?
The person in front of the person can save the life and being the power point for them.
So others are going to look for it, designer, to believe that things are tremendous and they never are going to be better, installation, to believe that there is nothing that you can do about it.
I was going on this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got a picture of a fear and I would like to read you his face.
She lost her son at the age of this year, and I wrote this journey just a couple of days ago, and it is with his allows and beauty that I read to the law of it.
"Hey, Rep. I imagine you are at the TED.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that she should go to the past this end of week.
I just want to leave you very much.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home to talk about it to their friends that you get to their friends, etc.
I am still quite interesting, but I'm going to save more ways to realize that Michael will not go home.
Michael was coming from Paris to San Francisco to see the part of the 40 to his father at the age of his father 19.
I never got there.
And I called the Palestine of Paris and he asked it as a decision of that night.
At the end of the next morning, two office came to my house, and I showed me that the cost of Michael was under the present.
And one of it had seen it out from the planet to the 1870s in the front of the day.
Thank you very much.
Who has not been a bad without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My bacteria are with your control.
And the Google, the Good Google God is supposed to be a journey through our beautiful bank, not a control.
Well, it's going to be this week, Vietnam."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go back to go back and get the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go out there.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
The 11 percent of 1970 -- it turned out to a call called a problem for a possible sounds in the top of the new part of the North neighbor.
I was going to know my mind and I looked at this man, Kenya Ben, and I started in the street.
When I looked at me in the top of the bank, and he was focused on that little terrorist that's going around the wall.
For the time and a half of the next time, I heard like Kenya talked about his definition and waiting.
Kenya decided for his way that day will come on on that car and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kenya came out, I was happy.
This is a new beginning -- a new life.
But I asked him, "What was what they made you go back and give you the hope and life another opportunity?
And you know what he said.
He said, "I love it.
I love to talk about and just spend?
I was a little bit after that, I got a cost of the mother of Kenya, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to get up.
"The "State South Brazil, nothing will bring the effects of the 12 percent of methodology, and you is one of the reasons that Kenya comes with us.
And yet, I think Kenya was running by help.
It has been done with a mental disease for which has been right media.
And I went to Kenya when I had only six months old, completely incredible from all of those high headlines, but because of God, we now know.
Kenya is in order -- as it says it.
We gave you thank God for you.
I was just going on with you.
And at the end she wrote -- "Ah when I saw the Google Hospital of San Francisco that night, you would work like the patient.
"I know I had to solve it.
And now, Kenya is a natural father and an act of the society.
I'm talking about the events of that day and their death with the hope that their story is inspired to others.
It is not just something I've found in the work.
It's person.
My grandmother is surprised with me.
That act -- despite the way to end his own pain -- I get the opportunity to know it.
This is what it does is what it does.
For most of the people, or those who will be able to be able to be able to take another person.
They just want their own pain to do it.
By the way, this is just about three ways -- red, the drugs or the diagram or death.
In my car, I've been involved and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and called it around the pattern.
And of those individuals that I've been directly doing, I've just lost two, but those two are too too much.
One was Jennifer.
The other one was a man who had been about a hours.
And for that time, I took the hand in three speeds.
At the end of the final way, I looked at me, and he said, "Well, I feel it, but I have to go.
And he came out.
How it was just surprising.
I want to say, though, that the great majority of the people that we get to talk about is that you don't know that they don't know.
And also, those few people who have come out of the bridge and living and they can talk about it, that one one one or 20 percent, most of those people have said that the second one of those people are left that they had to have been made that they had to have made a transition and they wanted to live in.
I say to people, the bridge is not only connected with San Francisco but also people.
That connection or particular that we do, is something that all of us and each of us should be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be going to be going to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be going to be going to be
The surface can be able to protect it.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inside you know what you're are, and a question of you, how do you become that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not just -- in any way I am alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally done the dream I had ever had from a year.
And my first was finally working with my really, with my inside me.
And by the reasons why I would remember more later, when I look at this picture I thought, I think -- the German George, you get it up, you get it.
But the past, I discovered that, you know, I'm going to start here.
All of us find our families, our religion -- our society, our society in history, even our body.
Some of them have the value to be able to be able to be able to be able to take it through the color of the skin or for the conditions of those who go to us.
These are people who are always going to be able to be able to be able to be able to accept it.
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my friends, a lot of my friends, my head even even my story.
I think this angry is called record.
This is the me.
They would tell me like "Boy because of the application of my genes.
I remember that my five years in the Philips, in my house, in my house, I always had this box in the head.
And my mother asked me, "Why are you always going to take that form in the head in the head.
I said, "Mom, it's my skin -- I'm a girl?
I knew then how to reduce.
The government has always met an amazing fact, but now we know that, actually, it's something more complex and microbe.
Because of my success. I never brought me to share my story -- not because I thought that I am a bad thing, but why the world is going to all of us who want to be able to look at it.
All of the days I would be woman.
I have mom and a family and a family that I would tell me like I go.
So many of them are not so understanding.
There is a long traditional culture in the active culture that is going to be able to get the general minister.
There is a wonderful girl of compassion there.
There is a single day, dance of the galaxies.
And when I was eight years old, I was in a picture in the Philips that I took these stories.
I was about the scale and I remember that this beautiful woman came up in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something was showing me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still coming from man, I met this woman called The TED.
It is the difference of a beautiful beauty control.
That night she said, "Why do you have not involved in the bone control?
He said to me that if he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to explore and sensory -- and that night, they put in the bank of water, and they were going on in front of the day and he was very early between over 40 hours.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was inside the world of beautiful.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from a beauty of beautiful women, but I can.
I had also met the God of designers, about everything when we went to the Republicans of Philips.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends from that community.
In the 200 my mom who had been moved to San Francisco, I call me and I told me that they came up with my high school that I could go to live to the United States.
And I was wrong.
I said to my mother, "Man: I am discovering.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and being a beauty of beauty?
But then, two weeks later, I call me and said, "You know that if you move to the United States you can change the name and the identity of government?
It was all I needed to listen to.
My mom told me that I was able to put two or my name of me.
She also moved up with me when I was going to go in Tick at the age of 11 years.
It's clear that in some of the most rural communities of Taba will make the most complicated controls, so many of them.
In that then in the United States, it was need to do the care before I was going to change the name and the game.
So in 2009, I went to San Francisco and I remember to look at the control of the direction with the name of the name and the future of future foreign.
It was a great time.
For some people, their opportunity of identity means to be able to be able to be able to get a transformation, but for me was the limitation to live -- to feel discovery.
Of course, my eyes were looking at them.
I feel that I could be able to make my dream and make New York, and being model.
A lot of not so much.
I think about this woman of Mars Allen Netherlands.
A young woman in New York who was going to live his truth but that, I was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality to live in.
Our subject rate is eight times higher than the rest of the population of the population.
And every 20 percent of us will make a global violence for the Doman Deney.
I'm in this stage because of a long story of people who come out and put it out of the intervention.
These are Mars Professor, John and San English.
Today, in this same time, I'm coming out of the artist.
I can't follow my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help each other to live their truth without a strange, no fear of it.
I'm here, exploring for a day there is no longer even more than 20 percent of Kenya.
My most profound truth took me to accept what I are.
You will do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, or John Santa, George, a quick question.
George Robert: Of course. You see, you know, you see the first thing.
So my advantage of support -- my parents especially to my family -- which is a very strong thing.
I remember all the times I have been asked to young young women -- I have heard -- and sometimes when I was called me and told me that his parents could not read it, I was called the phone -- I was called my mom and said, "Mother, you can call this woman.
A few times worked -- another not. It's just design identity -- that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us get a money to the neighborhood, and what I'm trying to do is put it on the table the fear that some times that state was not still, and that there should be a space that allows people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be down,
The blood movement is understanding compared with the genetic movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understood it.
There should be space for the culture and to ask questions and I hope you all are my additional man.
KB: Thank you. LG: Thank you.
In many private societies and college, the parents are usually told to you for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who were known by his daughter and I'm proud of it.
March started his company for education.
Before that, I was my son, but now I'm his father now.
Seconds and services, if we take a look at the history of humanity -- the story of women is the story of the information, from the development and the exploration.
You see, in the public society, right from the beginning -- when you get a child, their birth is not culture.
It's not a name, not for his father -- not for his mother.
The neighbor comes back to the mother to the mother and no happiness to the father.
And a mother would get a lot about having a child.
When you go to the first girl -- the first son, the first child, you put through.
When it gives light to the second child -- and with the hope of a son, when he took his third daughter -- it feels like a critical.
Not just the mother goes out, but the daughter -- the daughter is not naturally, when I grew up as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it gets in home, and the school starts to your brother to their brothers here.
Even the age of 12 years, somehow has a good life.
You can do.
It can play with your friends in the street, and it can move through the streets like a market.
But when I go in the approach, when I was 15 years old, he would have been happy to go out of his house without a mobile paper.
It's built to the four parts of your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes a control of his father of his father and his brother and his family and your family -- and if you bring the code of that modern support, it could even kill it.
And it is interesting that this course of tools -- not just affect the life of a bottom, as well as the life of the families of the family.
And so this brother is discovery of your life and happiness of their sister in the name of the modern subject.
And there is a little bit more of the private societies that is called a space.
It's supposed to be a good girl has to be very high and very humanity and so on.
It's the crisis.
The model of a good girl must be calculated.
It was supposed to be static and that I use the decisions of his father and his mother and the decisions of the analogy, even if you don't want it.
If you go with a man who doesn't like or if the house with a old man has to do it, because it doesn't want to be a decentralized discovery.
If you get it very young -- you have to get it out.
And they will call it a destiny.
And what happens at the end.
In the words of a poetry, "The cardiologist, and then it gives the more children and children?
And the subject of the situation is that this mother -- collected the same lesson to their daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this video video is a content and I know.
They wanted to be beautiful and brothers -- when I was born Santa, and for the first time, I don't like the real records, to be honest, but when I was there and look at his eyes, I was sitting there and look at his eyes -- I felt just honest.
And a lot of before I thought, I thought about his name, and I was excited with a high school of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Mars from Mars, and I call my daughter like this.
But when I went to me, they were all men, and I had my planet, and I took a line of my name and I wrote -- "March?
And when she grew up, when she was four years old and a half and a half years old in my school.
They ask you, why should I keep the analysis of a girl in a school.
Yes, I have to kill it.
You can give it to sit in Carlissare, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the private society, in the local societies -- is a great transformation for the life.
In one school it means in a school that means the relationship of their identity and his name of it.
A school to school means that has been in the world of dream and the applications where you can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five weeks, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised -- two weeks before, when I was able to get the forest of vision and it was in the real part of the family -- I couldn't remember the spaces of some of my sister single-caregivers.
And the reason was that I had never seen the name of my sister schools in any day.
So that was the reason why I value my daughter to me.
What my father couldn't give my sister to my sister or I thought I had to change it.
I used to learn the intelligence and the speed of my child.
And he was going to be with me when my friends came to see.
The animal is going to me to different research.
And all of these values -- I have been able to get them into their perspective.
And this was not just for it, just for Malani.
And I have impossible all of these good value in my school and kids for the same.
I was going to use the education.
I teach my children, I teach the students to forget the lesson of the adult.
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the name of the sea.
They want to look at beautiful and gentlemen, we went through more rights for women, and we come up to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon for us.
It was total for human rights and particularly for the rights of women.
It's called a transportation.
That means a business of the patient of the women in all political activity.
hundreds of schools were lost up.
The kids are going to go to school.
The women were used to use them and they stopped to go to the markets.
The music was stated, the girls and the state states.
It sounds like millions -- but a few of them would say, and it was close to have all of those people who kill and act when you talk about your right.
It's really argument.
In the age of 10 years, Mars became the right to education.
And he wrote a day for the base of the GDP -- he came up with it for the New York City.
And his voice was the most powerful time.
It was the way that it looks like in all the world.
And that was the reason why they couldn't be able to be able to clear their campaign and the nine percent of 2000, they were made in the head.
It was a happy day for my family and for me.
The world will become a big black hole in the world.
As my daughter was designed between life and death -- I was going to go back to my wife to my wife -- "I have to go up with what happened to my son, your son?
And he said, please don't tell you.
It will be able to do right now.
You put your life in play for the cause of the truth -- by the cause of the peace -- and by the cause of education, and your daughter will be inspired in you and you get it.
They were in the right way.
These few words that are a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
And when Mary was in the hospital and I had a street and a few days of head because his family black was coming up, I used to see a dark surface that was spread through my wife of my wife back.
But my son never started.
I used to say, "I'm good with my tour and with the influence in my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't consider it.
It was a concept for us, and we tell us.
They were going to be beautiful and sister -- we've learned from them how to be able to be in the most difficult moment, and I was happy to share with you that despite you that despite the rights of the children and the women, it's like any 14-year-old girl of 18 years.
I read when it wasn't just his task.
It goes on with his brother and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is there a special in my task that has made it so clear to Mars so value.
I say, I don't ask me what I did.
I asked what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their streets, and that's everything.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I went out of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion of me.
I am an engineering one.
And I want to tell you that I really have been done to the Montana group of Google -- where I've had a day to my car, the Department of Google Bondon, but all the work that I talk today about here about the science of the brain, and I did it before I went to Google or outside of my work there.
So having said this, there is a situation when you go to a brain.
You still feel about smart or not.
It's not going to be like this, can you become interesting?
And then I was looking at a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the market way, but it was the paradigm part of the center that creates important horizons and nurses.
And then I certainly have to be able to figure out how big to take -- from more than a two of the common policy every day, because if I didn't take anything -- die in a few hours.
Every day, during the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combination and a few minutes of chemicals and to try to get them, to follow with life.
More than one time I have saved me.
But by the way, I have an experience, so I decided that I would experience to try to try to be able to be able to get the early days because there is really no clear map that I say to do.
I started to test with different microbes -- and I was surprised by looking at how little changes in the data changed in the days changed my authority, my sense of who I was me, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly exciting case, for a few months, and I was brought up with two and a few months for a man, and I was surprised to see how my thinking.
It was always foreign, I thought all the time in sex -- and I thought it was the most smart person around the world, and -- of course, many times in the past I've put several guys like this, or maybe some of them who have been able to have a number of guys like this, or maybe some of them who have been able to have a number of
It turns out like a strange one.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be a region.
In fact, I was trying -- a little bit.
So I couldn't get it out.
It changed my days.
But I think that experience gave me a new support of men and about what they have to go through -- and then I read better with men.
And what I was trying to do is that I was going to take those hours and nurses, and so on. It was to reduce my intelligence after the disease and the control, my creation -- my food of ideas.
And I was thinking almost in images, and that became my point of mental record -- how you have those mental images that use to create privates, my ideas -- if you want to put up new ideas and by getting situation.
And this kind of thinking is not new.
Physics as humanity, and described and Honor will see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are people who question this idea, and there are a lot of questions about how the mind. For me is simple -- for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for the thought to create and invited it.
So after several years, I was going to find the right point and I have a lot of great mental genes -- really living -- and it was very state and good structure.
Now, I'm working on how to bring it very quickly these mental images of my mind.
So you can imagine what it would happen if a control direction was able to use their image only to bring the world that has the forest?
Or if a music could be able to make the music.
There are incredible possible with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only hard to get doing this is just to increase the solution of our brain school.
Let me show you why I think we're very close to this with two people who have been done by two groups that have been done by two groups that have been done by two groups that have been done by two groups that are made by two different groups in light.
They were used by the traditional technology, imagine by the future facility -- to represent the brain -- you can see the brain statement by Britain Gatestyle and their colleagues of Harvard.
The color of the left shows the scale of the brain of a person who would look at an picture.
The middle of the middle shows the scale of the brain of that same individual as you know, looking at that same picture.
The idea of the area was growing up the control of the central color of the left of the left -- you see the difference is a little bit.
This is a lot of different individuals with a lot of different images with a lot of different images -- always with a similar result of it.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same picture is a little bit about it.
Now let me share to you another experiment. This is the lab of John Ball in Berlin, California.
They were going to become the brains of the brains in the real visual field.
We put it in this way.
In this experiment. I showed the hundreds of hundreds of years of Yorker while they were studying their brains to create a great network of the brain of the brain of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and while it would be a new scale of scale.
The computer, using just the brain information of the school -- I decided to show what it seemed like the person was looking at it.
On the right you can see the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
And this left us to us.
We're very close to do it.
We just need to improve the solution.
And now, we remember that when you see an image and when you look at that same image -- you think about the same way.
This was taken to know with the sea brain systems that are available today, and their solution is just like a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the solution about a thousand times more to get a more profound look at a more profound thing.
How do we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the context and increase electronics.
I don't get me for that.
Many of them are trying to make new techniques of project for images -- even me.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get a lot of responsibility is to be in more large images -- but at this point, you know, more big people are only very small than a little bit of thousands of people as we need.
I put this idea, instead of the bigger images, we will make better.
We can create much more complex structures that are much more different enough to be able to be able to make a space.
And why do we care about that?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in the MIT was to make really big images -- right?
And yet most of the recent parts in the resource of innovation and beautiful solutions.
And at the time, instead of a massive piece of medicine, we use political patterns to the Francisco factory of Philip Francisco.
So, when you will change the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the Presidens of Presiden reaction, we can figure out the information that you can end up in a single scale.
And also, we can then be able to design our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use the GPS we should be able to measure not only the food of the extra surface, but the organizations and nuclear and neurons that I've mentioned and maybe even the new neural activity.
We will be able to get our ideas into a different way to digital media.
Do you imagine if we could go through the language of the language and we can get it directly into the thinking of thinking about it.
What would we be capable?
And how do we learn to deal with the truth of human thinking without factory?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be used to use it as a language to increase our ability of thinking and communication and community.
In fact, this same tool could take the face of America and similar disease.
We have a little bit more choices more than open this body.
In all ways, they take a year, going to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I talk to you this night to come out of the marketing, and not in a traditional sense -- not just from the galaxy season.
I think we all have a artists.
His transition may be to tell some person for the first time you love it or say to someone who is an extent, or to say to someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have been in life.
And everything is a hard conversation and even though our issues can be able to be able to be able to be living and have come out of that authority is something universe.
It doesn't like it, and we don't like it.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the World State Canada, a result in the city, and I was there, I had to put up several maps of the improve of the mission of the microscope of the military military -- I won't be able to be able to carry the landscapes of Alm as a class.
And it will be a sense that by the hospital of my high school, and because of the head I did a little bit -- I would ask a little bit of a little little little little little little little girl or "Boy?
And it would look like a straight signal in the table.
And I would go up with my manufacture a little bit more, I would take my head with a record story.
The father will be able to be able to see the period and the mother is going to take a piece of your son looking at his child.
But I would not say anything.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight it.
And that's a terrible sense.
So I think the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation to it.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
You're a girl or a girl?
A family science, but this time was prepared and I was going to go out of it in the fundamental issue in the table.  I had the chairs of Big French.
The German Latin States.
Even a free of the Veronge "little viruses of the viruses?
So I was going to go up and I went down and I went back and my spaces a girl of four years old with a red stage, looking at what it's not a challenge for a market dialogue, just a girl with a question, or a child or child?
So I was going to go back again, and I was able to talk about it about it, and I said, "Oh, I know this is kind of construction.
I have the short book like a child, and I see a child, but I am a girl -- and you know, like you like to use a red way, and sometimes you like to use a computer particular, and sometimes you like to use a computer party play.
Well, I am more of the kind of girl of a child plan.
And that little girl looked at me limited, and he said, "My favorite piece is violence and it has a fish.
So you can give me a fish, please give me a favorite?
And that was all of it. It's just "Good -- you're a girl.
What happens to the paradigm that I OK?
It was the most easy conversation of all that you've ever had before.
And Why? Because the girl of the weight and me, they were honor with the other.
So like a lot of us, I have lived in a lot of adults in my life, and yes, I often have to be a artists.
But inside the dark -- you can't know how color the walls are.
You only know how one is being living in a subject.
And this is how my adult is not different to your own or to the one.
Now, I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to come out of my temperature was more difficult than coming out of the side, but this is the stuff, and this is the stuff that is the stuff?
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain someone who have been done in the right bank is more difficult than saying it's been definitely?
Who can tell you that this story that I think is more difficult to tell you to your son of five years that are going to go to you?
There is no more difficult thing, there is only how hard it is.
We need to let us get the thing that is difficult with what it difficult for another person to make us feel better or better in relationship to our traditions, and we have to just feel that we all live something difficult because we all live something difficult because we all live something difficult because we all live something difficult because we all live something difficult because we all live
In some point in our lives, we all live in adults, and they can be able to feel security or at least more security than the other side.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their wall are made up -- a transition is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine the same 20 years.
And I had a horse college, a state and a stage of high school.
It was not the middle military to fight for any child of four years to go to the car.
I was going up by the fear of the fear.
My family, my friends, my friends that I've spent my entire life was trying to give them -- and now the world was going to get it back into the back of it.
I was looking at the page of a guy that all of us have come up for so long -- but if you don't take that grandmother, I will kill you.
One of my most exciting flowers was on the bottom of my sister book.
It was the first time that many between the invited they knew that it was good, and when I do my holes of home and my black story in my black sea and collection around the table and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who met me years ago.
And you try to talk about a time, one of the grandmother women, love January Line?
And the bank of the dance had started here.
"Oh, once I was in the Carolina."
Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San France?
Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's fast?
"Hey, you know my American American standard."
It's very good and I've never talked about having a note."
So, what is your favorite program program.
Our favorite program.
And you know who would love that?
Just is our favorite?
And then a woman. And then a woman.
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all of the grandmothers of grandmother.
Of course, it might have been easy to figure out where they were sitting on.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were spreading.
And what another thing you can do is they can be able to be able to go to someone but to speed?
If you're going to be car with someone -- you have to be prepared for the analysis that they do.
This is how hard connections are still going to be my strong point.
Do you think to anyone that I have come out.
But I am better, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Chinese Chinese.
Now, please look at this through the blood perspective. But they understand that what makes us go out of any adult is just the same thing.
Number one, they are a scale.
You feel the stream. They're you.
That girl in the coffee had no adult but I was ready for the table.
If you want someone to be genetic, the others should know that we can also know that we too.
Number two, you will just give them a digital. They just give them his parts.
If you know that they are generous, they do it.
If you say your parents who might be gentlemen, they will keep the hope that that could change.
I'm not going to give you a sense of food.
And number three, and more important --  --  You read the complexity of it.
You communicate your reality.
They are called about that.
And some can be able to be able to be able to be able to come up with what they have done, but it never goes up with what they are.
And yes, maybe some of them would feel defined, but that something in them.
Those are the experiences of them about what you are, but not their own own.
That's the story of them.
The only story that matter is that you want to write it.
So the next time you get in a dark dark that is going to make a radio, they have to know that we've all been there.
And you may be very alone.
Thank you, Berlin. They start the spin.
intelligence -- what is that?
If you take the story of how you have seen the intervention, a product example has been the famous California of Paris that the question of if a machine can think is as interesting.
And when I left David Discover this was done it as a practice to the professors of information like San Europe.
And so, a few years ago, I started a program to try to try to understand the social physical physical maps of the intelligence of intelligence people.
Let's go back a country.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a normal thing, who don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or from the Earth of the Earth, but that they have incredibly amazing and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a terrifies, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact of it.
But if you're from a non-position relationship that I don't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth of the Earth, they would be able to develop a physical theory that will explain how to explain how to explore the surface of a planet planet.
And so I guess this is the same question that the same question of understanding the physical nature of intelligence is.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I had a variety of issues through science, through a lot of discoveries, that I think, to a single single mechanism of the intelligence in the intelligence of the intelligence of the innovation.
You know, for example, for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally addressed for the development of the intelligence -- and in particular, for the development of state states that make the diversity of the future.
And finally, in the planet of modern movement there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take the skills of robots to kill the future freedom of action.
And so I took all these different issues and put them together, and I asked you, for a number of years -- there is a support mechanism for the intelligence that we could be able to get from all these different things?
There is only one science for the intervention?
And I think the answer is yes, what you're looking at is probably the most close environment to one and Martin, I was for the intelligence that I have seen before.
So what you're looking at here is a chance that intelligence is a force --    I act with the end of making the future.
You can act to measure the future of action.
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be applied.
The intelligence trying to kill the future of action and keep the open opportunities.
And so, I would have this equation, it's natural to question: what can you do with this?
How happy is it?
It looks like the human intelligence level.
It takes the architecture of antibody intervention?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show you some of the amazing activists of this simple education.
Narrator: recent researchers in collections have been suggest that the universe that produce more designers, or control, during their life should have access to more fundamental conditions for the existence of smart beings like us.
But what's going to be that if that technical collective connection between the box and the intelligence is a more prediction relationship to a more prediction relationship to a more prediction relationship of a more prediction relationship a more prediction?
What happens if the smart behavior is not only related with the production of the long-term process, but that actually comes directly from it?
In order to figure out, we have developed a form of software called Antarctica, designed to measure the power of the long power in any system that you find inside it.
It turns out, International could spend a lot of an animal intelligence -- play games of human games -- and even making money by doing access, all of that would have been able to do that.
So here are some examples of English in action.
Just like a field of foot without career, here we see the Arab transportation of a place using a car.
This behavior is a little bit in part because we never gave it a table to a table.
I just decided for his way to look at the planet.
So this ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the human rights and human resources.
This ability of use of tend to be able to be able to be able to be able to be international and anti-stars.
And as a few other animals can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get on the same time in the same time to feed food here, here we see that English can make a version of the model.
So this consequence of trust has interesting connections for the economic plan and in a variety of other field.
And this is absolutely an opportunity to a variety of communities.
So for example, here we see it to be able to play a game of put against yourself -- it will take their potential for the game.
So here we are going to try to make new connections in a social network where the friends are connected and keep with the network of the whole good thing.
So this same ability of an area is also having access in the carbon of health -- in energy and intelligence and intelligence and innovation.
So here we are going to be able to try to organize the front of a back of a back flow, and they found out and use the Carter of Palestine to take a global level in the Arab to the Park.
And in the same way, English is used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able and transportation and transportation.
And finally, here we see English specific to find out and pick up a building strategy -- value in a series of activity of action.
This scale of risk is going to have a statement of adults in front and seriously.
Australia Billiest -- what you've seen is that a sea of marketing human human computer computers -- like the use of tools -- and they will walk out and social control -- all of the way of a single education, which leads to a system to measure their future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep show.
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the robot -- the brain service -- there was always the concept that if we develop smart machines there would be a record region.
The machines will get against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all of the concept of the record to the industry.
It is not that the most intelligent machines become smart and then they try to get out of the world.
It's all controlled -- that the ability to take the control of all the possible future is a more fundamental piece that the intelligence of the intelligence -- than the general intelligence can be able to be able to be able to be able to take the control rather than being in the brain.
Another important conversation is the base of the grandmother.
Do you often ask me, how is it that I would look at the object of this kind of magnet?
My equivalent to that room to go to the decisions to help you build artificial intelligence or to help us understand human intelligence is the following -- the intelligence must be seen as a physical process that would try to be seen as a physical future.
Thank you very much.
We are in a powerful point in the human history, something between the content of stars and lost the planet we call "Look."
Even though in the last few years, we've used to have a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth.
The World mission of NASA has discovered thousands of planets who are used around other stars -- which is the way that the Earth is just one between the thousands of millions of planets of our galaxies of our family.
Kenya is a space.
The data.
In the way, this helps us understand if these planets are small and robots like the stars of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their surfaces.
And at the time, this day about if these planets that we find are traded or not.
And the personality, as we are finding this team of world possible, our own planet.
The year 2000, it was the most expensive career.
Grains and ice ice that they've been with us from thousands of people now are getting in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've talked to global scale.
But I am not a science of the climate -- and I am not a sense.
But it was studying the ability of the planet in the end, with the hope to find places in the universe where to find out beyond our planet.
You could say that you can look for extraordinary opportunities in the interventional sense.
Now, as some really interested in the universe of life in the universe I can tell you that the more similar planet on Earth, more of our own planet.
Every one of these new world.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars here.
Mars is small and religion and despite to be a little bit more from the sun. It can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make this for a mission like the Kack.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been based on the past.
Our window like the "Canada is going to get their surface to look for them about the organizations of life and as we know it.
And the signals that the advance, like the Mars Monor, they take shows out of the marine atmosphere -- and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their space.
The private companies now make not just some space food but also the possibility of living in Mars.
But even though all of these wonderful images remember us to the challenges of our planet, places that are involved in our imagination with the ideas and paradigms, in compared with the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
So let's take the existence of our planet.
Even in the most expensive places and more except of the Earth -- the air is a service and an oxygen of an oxygen for our traditional boats to thousands of dollars.
I worry that this include for the consequence of Mars and other plants are going to get a big and basic surface, and the belief of some that I think I would wait out there to get out of this influence of the only planet of the only planet that we know that is really head, the Earth.
For a lot that I would like to like the interesting experience, I am in deep with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars but to say that Mars will be there to save the humanity is like to imagine that the capital of the Talk is going to tell you that the capacity of truth is going to have more late in the soldiers --   Thank you.
But the goal for the interesting exploration and the terrible pressure will not control it.
No, they are actually heart of the same community: the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
We have to be able to put them in our world in our world in our world as an extraordinary way.
They just find more about home.
If we can understand how to create and keep space space, in the American areas and international industrialisms of the land -- maybe we can make the need to make our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment.
A lot of years ago, a lot of the English East Francisco asked -- trying to realize that our universe has been there for a long time, and we hope that there are a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the test of an extraordinary life to now.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible problem to the Park of Facebook is that when the characters are going to be able to be able to be able to be living by living in the stars -- they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the original of the planets that they published this development out.
It is a chance to think that just the private choice will save us from ourselves, but the private pressure and the private experience can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to save the American objects of Mars for the human people, then we should be able to support the water even more easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to save the water even more easy in Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I used my own home.
And as I was in the front front of looking at my police, I realized I didn't have the sides.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the rest of the company, where he had left them.
So fast I tried to look at all of the other people and sold -- and they were all good.
I thought about to call a career, at least had my cell -- but at the middle of a colleague could be able to take a long time to come back, and I did it.
I couldn't go home from my friend in John to spend night because I had a early early back to Europe at the next morning, and I grew out of my own partner.
It turns out, but I sure I don't get more expensive than a car at a middle at the time -- so I thought despite the streams, it was going to be a good particular.
I am a professional neuron and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
And he looked at the coral line of the street -- I would move up the levels of adult and closed the thinking.
And when I came to the factory in the car, I realized I didn't have my paradigm.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without a warrior.
And I started to ask me, if there was something that could do -- systems that I could put in the place that they have to put up bad things.
Or at least if you have bad things, that they keep the possibility that it is a total capital.
So I asked me to think about that, but to a month later, my thought was not coming up.
I was going to get up with my police David Kenya, and a little bit I was talking about I was talking about the window and that I had forget my paradigm, and let me share with me that I had been producing something called a professional presentation.
It's something that he had learned from the George Kenyan Deliver, who had written from this a few years before, I knew as much as the beginning.
You all know what the police is.
Every time there is a device, a team of experts comes and try to figure out what he came wrong, right?
In the beginning, as you explain Daniel, you look at it and try to figure out all the things that could come wrong, and I try to figure out what it can do to figure out that things are going to be able to make things happen.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the form of a first.
Some of them are individuals, others are not so exciting.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, making a place for the things that will be able to be able to lose it.
This kind of common sense and it is, but there is a lot of science that support this rate of how our own space works.
There is a structure in the brain called the Hill, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a sense of the care of the important things -- where it is well, where the fish is, which is the fire of the framework and emotions.
The ball is the part of the brain that goes up in the states of London, in the U.S.
It is the part of the brain that allows them to find their grandmothers.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment -- they came up with the common sense of the controls and even so they could find their new.
They were not used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a very evolution of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
So this is the reason to lose the car of the car and galaxies and paradigm.
So at home they have a place for the sides, a garden with the door -- maybe a doctor documentary.
And for their paradigm, a particular room in a particular one.
So for your leadership galaxies, a particularly particular moment.
If you take a place and they are standards with it, their things will always be there when you look at them.
What happens to the journeys?
They take a picture of their own crime of the crisis of the crisis -- the limitation of control, particularly that I think of the same way they are in the audience.
And if these things are lose or reactions, it can be able to make it the surface.
These are some of the most obvious things.
And remember, when you go down there, the brain.
The colleague is transportation and intervention the thinking.
So part of the primary practice is to recognize that under states we're not going to be in the best time, and you have to put the systems in your own.
And there is maybe no more good situation that when you face a medical decision for it.
And at some time, we're all going to be in that situation -- of having to take a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or one of the way to help us with a decision to help us with a decision to help you with a decision to help with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical experience.
But this is the way that it looks like a chance for all of the medical decisions -- and in fact for the takes of food decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that you have to take a real evolution of the facts.
So we knew that they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I know the result of the theory and the color is a little bit of a back."
You all know that the high control is very much with a bigger risk of medical diseases -- the heart.
So one is thought to have the high color is not the best -- then the doctor says, "I would like to remember a drug that helps you reduce the context, a situation?
And perhaps you have heard of the sounds -- and you know it's one of the most effective drugs in the world today.
So you think of it -- "Yes, recently the state?
But there's a question that you should do then, a state that should be able to ask that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the happy companies even less.
It's for the National, the number needs to treat it.
And what is this, the New News?
It is the number of people who have to take a drug or survive to a heart in any medical project before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of strategy transformation is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not remember something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not close to the doctor -- and if it is clear of somebody like me.
We have not understood very well the research measurements.
But the solutions of Kacksterk that 90 percent of food works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most remarkable state -- what do you think it is.
How many people have to take before you help a person.
300 dollars.
This is about the research of the civil individuals Jerusalem Mars and Paul diagnostic, and I would have a way that I was going to do in Legal for Legacy.
And I just explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before you can avoid a single area of heart -- or a brain or another network.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of us will go up with my context.
Why don't I do? Let me give you the rest of all of them.
But then you have to ask for one more, and it is, "I say "States of the secret effects of second."
For this particular medicine.
And those including things including the tradition of the market and artificial pain, but now you think, "The five percent is not very likely to me, even like to take me to me, even to take medicine?
But a moment.
Do you remember that they don't think of climate.
So think about how to make this with the time, so you don't have to make the cause of reasons in the action.
300 people take the food, right? On a person has helped it, five percent of the 100 of the 100 percent of the 100 percent of them have high school.
One has 15 times more likely to come down by the happy that you help you the medicine.
I don't say you should or not take the system.
I just say that you have to have this conversation with their medicine.
The medical rate requires it, is part of the intervention of an information of information.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to figure out the conversation about if you want to take the teachers or not.
You may be thinking I've launched this number on the air for the value of the cardiologist, but actually this number of need to try to work that is pretty much.
So for the heart that most of it is done in most of the majority of 50 percent of the property for cancer -- the number needs to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
So it is, 40 surgery for one person who has help.
And the secret effects in that case, are produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those including the impact or school discussion, control influence, first record, financial control.
And if you have a strong and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just will give a year or two.
So the idea of the oil is to think about time the questions that you can put the conversation on the context.
You don't have to do all of this in the environment.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of times a lot of times, you want to be a more short life, or a long life that could have a lot of pain to the end.
These are the things that you speak and think about now, with their family and their own would move down.
They can change in the case of the time, but at least one is built in this kind of thinking.
remember, our brain.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
It goes up with a development, it doesn't need the digital system, or the lab or the memory system, because if the body is spending the sexual in those things, it doesn't be the teacher of the legal, so nothing of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that are going on for those moments of stars is the global thinking.
So we have to understand to think about the future to these kinds of situation.
I think what's important here is to recognize that all of them are relationships.
We all are going to go back at the time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those factors, to put the systems in the place that will help you keep the day, or to figure out that bad things happen in the first place.
And I was going back at the night at the night at Montana, when I came out of my journey -- my control I put me up with a piece of combination with the door -- with a door of the door in the same.
And I have to argue that I still have a lot of letters that I have never been able -- and so on.
So I'm not very proud -- but I see the organization as a gravity process, and I'm going to do it.
Thank you very much.
Inforture, Paul is my favorite music.
It means to play sure.
If you are playing a model and you see one of you -- you need to play more surprised.
Two person, even more survey.
When you go up with the surface of it.
This is my head of a tree -- there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of countries can have never got to get to a complexity complex.
That's my designer of signals, a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the AIDS, a little bit of my own story.
And the French of the French landscape came through the decade of 1950, and with the time of the time, it has been moving with local seconds, and it's developed the language that we know today as AIDS.
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born to believe me that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sound are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
And as a South person who lives in a world of sound -- it's like if I live in a friend country -- following their rules and behaviors and robots without controlled.
So how do you understand the sound of sound.
Well, I see how people are behavior.
And people are like my heads and they apply the sound.
I learned and control that behavior.
And at the same time, I've learned that I can create social statistics, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example.
"I don't see the parent?
You don't do a lot of robot in the beginning of the Africa partner?
You don't think, and when you're starting -- I mean, I would not take the cost on the planet?
And this is all I call it something like that.
Maybe I think about the sound of sound more than the average person do it.
I am sure of solutions.
And I'm always waiting with neurons the sound of the sound that is going to come to the way.
From there, this day.
TR: So to decide to decide it.
SJ: So I will go on.
TED for analyze.
You can see that the program has no news on the line.
That is because the lines are already going to be used to sound across the sounds and sounds like this.
In the current culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for the Google.
A typical group has five light.
However, for me, you will do it with my place so it doesn't feel nature.
That's why I just have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berkeley, Alice, for a critical spectrum there.
Before this time, I had worked as a particular.
For this summer I saw months and species of different galaxies, and while I was from a place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that point, the sound was the trend and that was called the attention.
There was no visual art.
Now the sound has been in my theory of art.
I'm going to make it more of the art.
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know so well that not only is that it doesn't just experience through the heads.
So I can feel it in the way that I can be able to do it, or even as an idea.
And so I decided to recognize the sound of sound and put it into my art.
And everything that had taught me about the sound to sound and I decided to leave it and developed it.
I started creating a new job.
And when I put it to the art community, I was impossible with the amount of support and attention that I received it.
I realized that the sound is like the money, the power -- the context: social movement.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was a single thing -- it was some of a person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to leave me to me and my own artistic work, or I could work.
And I got it to me.
There is a massive culture on the language.
And just because I don't use my living voice to communicate to the eyes of society is as if he didn't have a voice at all.
And so I have to work with people who can support me to the same and become my voice in my time.
In that way, I'm able to be based on the current society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions -- I work with a lot of different interactions from AIDS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
I'm going to help me be listen to me.
And their voices have value and weight here.
I was going to be able to ask their voices -- I am able to keep a way of value a little bit of something like this, like to take a protection with a very high instrument.
If I'm not going to run with this practice -- I feel that I could stay on the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new critical measure -- show in the world of music.
And I used to see the similar between music and AIDS.
For example, a social never can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to start on the public.
And the same thing can be able to tell you about a concept in America.
The two are very spaces and the amazing things that means that changes can be able to affect the whole meaning so much of the signals like the sounds like sound.
I'd like to share you a memory of the planet, so they understand how the TV works.
So you can imagine a planet.
The American is designed in a lot of different professional paradigm.
If you get a different approach for each side while it comes up with the piece, like the family experience, the movement of the body, the way, the shape of your hand and like that, while the pill, the English is a crazy language -- as if you were going to happen to be a crazy language.
However, the AIDS is more like a car, you need the 10 degrees in the way to explore a clear control or an idea.
If you just just change the airplane, we will create a completely different meaning to create a completely different.
The same thing happens to the music in how much to the more and village.
In TED, when you use these different gravity particles, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is in that?
This is the signal signal in that?
I'm seeing you.
Let's look at it.
Oh, I was calculating.
There you go.
What are you going on?
There you go.
So I was able to think about it, and if I look at the American through the lessons of music.
If I had to create a second and it takes it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of "Line: the sun goes out and it gets it.
This is all the day.
If you do it and reduce the speed of the speed of the speed you see as a social piece here.
All the day.
It feels that the same thing can tell you about the whole night.
"The whole night.
This is all night, in this day.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of nights, "North "North "North --  --   "The night?
I feel that the third has more music than the other two.
And this represents how the time is going to get the time in American and how the difference in the body can express changes in time.
For example, one of example, is a hand -- two hands. It's two hands -- the present becomes more close and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is in the space.
So the first example is a lot of time.
I mean, "the "little "Time -- and the last one, which is my favorite -- with a very dark idea and diagnosed at a time, there was once a time.
The common time is a musical term with a space of four time.
However, when I look at the word time I think about the same time.
You're going to look at MT: I'm right right now.
We have the program through the head and the period.
(Audience: Mill, Gore off "Bank" -- "The County -- "Mandela -- Mars, free forest I'm going to show you a form of the hand called "Christian "short?
Can you do it?
All of the hands on the high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head as the lose -- something like the computer time or "The same time.
Yes, very good.
And that means the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help to help us in all the culture and the languages of seconds around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do this again.
And now this.
It means "Mandela in the TV.
Now the third thing. Please go back again.
And again.
It's marriage in the America.
We're going to do the three together.
"Well, "Chimpanzee and miles?
Well, it works all of it.
They look at how the three states are very similar -- all of them in the head and the losing -- but they try to mean very different.
It's amazing to see how AIDS is living and presentation, as the music.
However, we live in a very automatic world.
And it's just because the AIDS doesn't have social value.
We have to start to figure out what the social value is.
And this could be a way to make a more exciting society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be surface to learn AIDS.
The AIDS is a risk and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to send you to open up to the eyes, to open the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And I never know, you can even look at us.
Thank you.
Dense Kenya, Hey, that's me.
And my parents said, "You can put it all, but after you have to stay it?
And this is what it looks like.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
And so I grew up in a bunch of evidence or an impact of information -- I must say, because the adults told us to protect us to protect the truth of the truth.
When I do that, I found sure that adults also interact and that it's not very good for the other ones of others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teach and I have been involved in the National school.
You don't have to wait a lot to wait a lot for my students to walk out of the line.
So as well as good cities, we call the pictures, and no, it's not looking at it, and if it is, I don't do it.
It's three to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans are going to get plastic people.
It's kind of specific.
And in the last decade, we've been coming out with these great banks and networks -- to pick up those pieces of plastic to study under the microbes, and we changed this information in a map.
But it would make a disease, and it's very expensive and it is also very close to use those huge banks.
So along with my students -- with six to 15 to 15 years, we're going to invest a better way.
We have to transform our little class in Harvard Kong in a tank.
We started to build this metaphor of work with a statement for a very low children to be able to participate it.
And I'm going to say, the children who make electric tools are really great and safe for you.
Not enough.
Let's go back to the planet.
We reduce the plastic and we reduce it the size that we found it in the ocean -- which is very small, because of their framework.
That we do.
I leave it to the image of my sides.
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope it works.
And we decided that instead of taking a plastic parks -- we just take information.
In the use of a robot -- we take a picture of this plastic -- the children are excited by the robots with the robot.
Then we created what we call "The prototype protect."
We are so fast. We are so fast.
And we try to take them up and how we put it into access and we put it into a fundamental robot that would move on the water and for the plastic that we have there, and this is the image that is the image of the robot.
So we see the piece of plastic plants that are directly through the feeling while the computer computer is going to protect this image and measure the size of every particular and to get a picture of the plastic amount of plastic in the water.
So we took this invented step in a website in a website called "The "Islamists with the hope that someone else is even better even more.
The great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to be trying to do it.
And I can invest my local problem, but my students in Harvard Korea is a very good thing.
You see the news -- you can see the Internet, and they get up with this picture.
A child, maybe about 10 years old, it was going to be a oil death, just using their hands in States, the self-assembly self-assembly standard in the world in Berlin.
They were very surprised because this is the water that they do, is the water in which they go in, the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can see the water that the water is married, the back and the oil are also in the bottom and when all of them is very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called specific, which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first project of a team that can be used through all kinds of supposed to produce different species, which can help us identify what there is in the water.
Let's take this test with a feeling and we put it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that more of us to solve a local problem, or to send up a local problem, my students used their job and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to send a problem to "States: I saw a second experiment to make a second experiment and I wanted to go up a little bit more far -- maybe a more difficult problem, and as close to me.
I am a half and half of the French and maybe remember, that in 2010, there was a record in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan in Japan at all.
It was so violence that you get a lot of giant sides, called the statements, and those techniques made several cities in the cost of Japan.
More than 15 people died in a incredible.
It also gives the national power of Francisco -- a nuclear center of the water.
And today, according to the instruments a average of 300 tons are still forced from the nuclear plan in the Parkinson's Ocean.
Today, the ocean of the Paris has a control of collective paradigm.
If we go to the cost of it, we can measure the record of forest everywhere.
But if we look at the map -- it seems to be the most part of the architecture of the control cost of the Colompace cost and most of the time, and so on.
Well, reality is a little more complicated than that.
I have come back to Ford every year from the activity and invented in the way in other scientists -- the land -- the red -- and this time we want to take the children.
Of course we don't take them, the parents didn't afford it.
But every night we focus to the control center -- here you see the use of different machines.
It might seem to look like they didn't take the work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with activity all their life.
And so many with them we discovered the data that day and talk about what we are going to do later, the structures, and so on.
And to do this, we created a massive map of the region around the brain of nuclear power.
We created the magic map -- we invented fish to represent data in real time of the material, and we put water for the water.
And with this we could have been able to notice that the architecture of the roof was based out from the top of the mountain to the right system.
It was a straight station.
But with the based of this we organize a civil experience, the most close to the nuclear center to the face.
We are going to go up to a hundred miles of the nuclear center and with the field of the purpose of the area we were able to get service services with a serious record of the measure that we invented and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build and build them.
So here we see a progress, we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different stars, also with the open school technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more food because we've only been starting to measure the day we have done.
We haven't started trying to solve the problems.
I asked me if I should give the room and try to invest better ways to do all these things.
So the car became a little bit so small for what we found is an industrial institution in Harvard Korea and we turn it into the biggest space of social impact and the environment.
This is in the center of Harvard Kong, and it's a place where we can work with the way that we can work with it, metal, a little bit.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of architects, and where adults can be children again.
Studios? Audience.
The strange Arabic: we ask things like, we can invest the future of the movement with religion energy.
For example.
Or are we able to help in the movement of the age of the age of the age of the airplane age to build their billions in new electricity vehicles in new electricity vehicle in new electricity?
The plastic -- the oil and architecture are terrible lines, but the worst thing that we can leave our children are the minds.
We can't allow them to protect the children of the real subject because we need their imagination to avoid the solutions to invest the solutions of the solutions.
So, we have scientists -- creative, consumers, we need to practice the next generation so that they worry about the environment and people, and so that it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two degrees to two leaders of design design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of paintings, the other one of a single single single single single single day.
One of them is simple, the other one.
A matter about the environment, the other thing.
One is designed by nature.
He told him that when he looked at the movie in Brazil, I saw a first thing I fight to be a book.
The car was only thought of Michael English.
But the living beings are not completely called.
They believe them.
And in the smaller contexts of life, the cells, we take all the information that we lost it for every cell to work and to recognize it.
The tools are also having consequences too.
At least from the industrial revolution -- the world of design has been taken by the factors of the ability and production in the way.
The monager lines have done a world made of parts of parts -- getting the image of designers and architecture to think of their objects as a particular part of parts of different parts with different factors.
But you don't find a lot of human material in nature.
Think about the human skin for example.
Our fantastic cells are demonstrated with dance dollars.
The plants of the team are more likely with small people.
You just just like fish, the other thing as a barrier, and yet, it's the same skin -- there are no parts -- there are no particles.
It is a system that will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go up with the food of the scale of electricity.
Here's a difficult screen that represents my view of the world, the democracy of every design of every design and an area to work on the classroom and the gene -- between the machine.
These two view of the world, my left memory and the right and street, and stars, is shown in the two streets after me.
My work, in his most simple level, I try to bring these two vision of the world, getting out of the control and about growth.
They probably said, why do it now?
Why did it be possible for 10 or even five years ago.
We live in a very special time in history, a red moment, where you get four designers that comes to access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the interest of these four company, my team and I created me.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
And so we designed objects and structures and tools and tools through scale -- like this arm robot with a fourth room with a 24 feet with a visual rate that some day that one day that some day is going to be able to figure out there with the collection.
So here we have seen the classroom, an architecture of the ancient architecture -- and it has created a screen where every car is just a single way to move the form of light and the heat through him.
In our next project, we started the possibility to create a cause and a face. This was for a death device of Park with Iraq are heading here. It's like a second skin made from one piece of piece, record around the cartoon.
And so many of them with 3D printing prototypes, we made this cause and lack of 3D partnership without the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This house has to make food materials and blood in the research of 20 ideas.
This is the solution of a human body.
It is also the relationship of a CO2 place.
That designers have access to this high school of high school and to the visual institutions -- it allows us to design products that are not just the form of our bodies but also the physical structure of our tasks.
We've also designed a change -- a room at the same time.
The Prince Project, my colleague, we went back to nature to figure out, and by designing this pattern of surgery surgery, it becomes a solar.
We started this 40 different properties that are going to go in the record, and they will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to pressure in the human body.
The surface of the surface -- in the nature -- I would see their function not through the other material of another material or another application, but I would find out of the materials.
But it is normal natural nature.
There are no parts in nature.
I didn't grew up in a religious place, but when I was young -- my grandmother told me stories of the Boston -- and one of them went up and he came up with a lot of what I care about.
As she came up with the third day of creative, God went to the Earth to grow a real free free of freedom?
So for that first French tree there would be no difference between transport, water, languages and free.
All the tree was a Africa.
In change, the land made the trees to create trees with traditions, close and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask me, "What would the design look like if the objects are made of one piece of part."
We're going to go back to a better state of creative?
So we would look for the bank material -- the kind of material of the fundamental tree with frankly, and we found it.
The second baby in the planet is called similar, and about 100 million tons are produce every year for organisms as a sharks, services, schools and food.
We thought that if we were able to support their own properties -- we could generate the fundamental structures in one piece of it.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal marketing --  we asked a lot of cards of carbon, and we put them up and we put it out of the control.
It will be able to be able to be able to be able to get a particular advantage of properties -- from dark and open, to the light of the light.
So to imagine the structure to a big scale -- it's built a system with a little bit of an extraordinary control that was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be relevant.
The robot could see the pieces of the material on the street and create these structures made from a single matter of the 12-year-old material of a long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are literally, they let them take a natural way to find a natural way to the air.
So why are we trying to design with plastics?
The air bullets that were a construction of the impact that you were used to put in order to tell pictures that came on for the planet in the planet in the planet.
I together with our colleagues in Harvard and MIT -- we invented the bacteria designed to change carbon carbon of the atmosphere and turn it into the street.
So for the first time, we've been able to make structures that make their support without service to balloon, and if you take even more -- and you get even more -- and if you take even more of them.
A religious traditional flower carrier.
It will work with an old material, one of the first ways of life on the planet, with a little water and with a little bit of biological biology -- we have transform a structure made in an architecture.
And here is the best part -- for objects designed for advantage, put into the sea -- will make it the moral life, and put it into the ground, help grow a tree to grow a tree to grow a tree process.
The ocean for our next experiment is using the same design of design was the solar system.
We look at the possibility to create robot to keep life.
So to do that, we have to take the bacteria and control their food.
And so as the present stage, we did our own table of elements: new ways of life created completely factors and additional form in biological ways.
I like to think of the visual biology as the limited analogy, just instead of using the most biological motors, they have new biological forms within very small ways.
This field is called metaphorical mechanism.
We imagine our own 3D costs to control the flow of these local bacteria banking.
In our first piece of rock, it was changed to the middle of microscope.
The first is the activity.
It lives in our oceans and in the water.
And the second one.
One turn the light on the side, the other one is going to go up and produced biological biological buttons.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met them.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of rock.
Think about it as an evolution -- not by natural selection, but for design.
To tell you these relationships -- we have created a single thing that goes to the distribution of the distribution that will help these bacteria and that they take these bacteria of the way.
And then we started to grow those cases in the human body, looking at the products of the material in the way that we need to do it.
So if we wanted more people, we would have a lot more transportation.
This particular system of performance, when it comes to a strange to the other, they would take 60 meters away.
This is a half of the land of a street of the street, and 10 times.
And here it is, as a program at TED -- our first particular picture, which is a little bit of brilliant lines with life in the rock.
Thank you.
Michael Steve said, "We are critical crisis -- only half is done?
What if design will be able to protect the other mile?
And if we could create structures that are going to look at the life?
And if we could create personal microbes that were going to be able to make our skin -- and they would get out of the term and study our body?
Think about this as a way of using biology as a way of understanding biology here.
I call this stuff of the materials.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D impact is very much made by the careers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
And I think he was going on.
This show of the guilt, for example, created a very sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is material.
The factory is not adult about this level.
It makes it through the combination not about two materials, but two of two projects in different Day.
One act as a result, the other one is the period or the material, using those factors between it.
And this happens through scale.
And the number of the first one is going to be asked in the environment -- I created a sense of terrorist, and then it starts to kill a company of company.
The train and the understanding -- the two forces of life, they get in a single material one.
With the end of understanding how this complex process, we put a small picture to the head of a seven season, to the hospital.
So we put it into a box with a box with magic sense, and that allows us to create this course of points in three and to see the architecture of the care of the care of the sea season.
However, when you put it up with the blood surface in a planet, not within a box -- we realized that he would have a plan of a plan and still make a plant soldier.
So we started to design different environment, and we have discovered that the way the way, the company, the structure of the career, it was taken directly by the environment.
You know, you know, you know, you can take the seasons of seven to the death inside their careers, their seven percent and it is used in traditional industry.
We saw that they were able to be able to be able to be able to make a form of control without a single cardiologist.
And we would take it out, and we could create these things.
And so we choose this process to the architecture.
We had a military robot doing several seasons and we put it into our own.
We knew that the supply surfaces in the bottom towards the more dark and free areas, that's why we use a solar death to reduce the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or hearts, to make the rains of the light and the cause of the cause of the street of the structure.
We were prepared to get the transitions.
We were able to have a hundred galaxies of seven to a sea of seven on it.
And after taking them four weeks, they were prepared with us.
We put them up in the bottom of the anti-particular, and while they were done, they were going on, they were transformed, they would be able to be able to put up, and life began again, like us, like us, but a lot more controlled.
Ben Francisco said that the universe is the big intervention, and I was right.
At the middle of the biological sign of the self-assembly robot room, they do all of this paradigm in the world.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, 150 weeks of sex will take 600 miles away.
And in a very simple culture, this is also the lights of the season.
The polices, after the school, they produce a hundred million dollars.
And this could be used for 200 dollars in the future.
So here are the two vision of the world.
A guy who has been a religious arm -- the other one of them will come together.
If the last amount of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings that are going to us, to form a couple of two materials -- the designers must have to bring these two vision of the world.
What brings us out of it, of course, in the beginning of it.
So here is a new age of design -- a new age of creativity -- that it takes us from an inspired design in nature to a nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Do you take your hand if you ever asked them, "What do you want to be a majority of life?
If you had to remember what when they had when you ask the first time this?
You can show you with the drugs.
Three three, five three, five -- five one.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be more more than me?
It has been able to make them a little bit.
Any disease.
I'm someone who could never answer the question to the question -- "What do you want to be more than me."
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest -- but I had too much.
And in the school, I was going to get the English, and the art and the arts and the website and I developed the website in a country called the Francisco threat called Francisco Turkey.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I really like to test and think of all of us, for a long time and energy.
But with the time this sense of adult, this feeling of it, this is already not a challenge -- it comes to be a record.
And I have to leave it.
But then I was interested by other things, something completely different, and I would look at it in it, and I'm going to give me and I'm going to be able to give me the mom, and then I found this point -- and then this point is starting to go back.
And finally, I want to leave you.
But then I'd like to find something new and different, and I'd like to focus on that.
This pattern made me a lot of anti-stars, for two reasons.
The first was because I was not sure how I was going to know all of this in a face.
I thought that I had to choose one thing -- black all of my other patients, and let me go back to it.
Another reason why I made a little bit more personal was a little bit more person.
I thought there was something wrong about this, and something wrong in me to not be able to stay at all.
And I was concerned to have fear to the computer, or to be despite, or to be applied or my own success.
If you can remember my story and these feeling -- I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have to have been able to have been able to be able to have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able then.
They ask yourself where they learned to save the meaning of bad or animals to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they learned it, they learned it from the culture.
And we ask us first of all, "What do you want to be more than the majority of more?
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no matter what you care about that age.
You would have a question to make a question to put up free response in the children like, "I'm a "little ant or "I want to be a particular?
They understand the design of Harvard here.
This question will be done over and over again as we grow in different ways -- and so on, the high school students are asked to tell you that they are going to play in school.
And at some time, what do you want to be more than more more more than more than it?
It's going to be the beginning to be the fish for what it looks like.
Why?
If this question is going to be inspired to the kids with what they might be, not inspired to save everything they might be.
In fact, it does right right now, because when someone ask you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though you have a good thing and say, "Oh, you know, you can be adding and say, "Oh, you can't be a value of violence and policy.
You have to choose?
This is Dr. Bob Chinese --  and he is a real viruses of violence and particular.
And this guy Nieve, and this is what it looks like to become incredible, and straight and creative discovery.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you heard is that they will have to choose it.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life life is very identify in our culture.
This is this idea of the destiny or the real view, the idea that every one of us has something to get out of their time in this land and you have to figure out what that thing and during your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected in this way.
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that will hold up their quality and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that mouse.
And so you can feel just just one.
You can feel that it doesn't have a democracy.
And it felt wrong with one.
There's nothing bad in you.
You are a complete.
A material is someone with a lot of interest and creative activity.
It's a ball for it.
It could help you in three parts of the mass, mathematically, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that understand the same idea, as a stage, relatively.
And during the decade of the Red, the idea was who was very good in distribution material.
Bang Shanghai is like the streets like the streets?
They used any fear that you like or send you to you or send you a own.
It looks like a kind of advice to a world, we can't be able to agree with one individual.
It is easy to look at the material as a self-assembly or apply that you have to see.
But what I've learned to talk to the people and writing on these ideas in my website -- is that there are huge forests in this way.
So here are three wonderful surfaces.
One, the strategies of ideas.
It is to say, the combination of two or the creating something new in the interesting.
Chris and Richard Boy would explain his shared institutions in cartoon, view of data, and mathematics, and design and design in the start.
And I'm a company that creates a company that creates relatively interactive.
And San and Richard was happened to him this idea only by his mission of skills and experience.
The innovation happens in the interesting.
This is the new ideas.
And the materials, with all of their antibodies, can be able to access to a lot of these points of the interesting.
The second amount of scale is a quick learning here.
When the males are interested for something, we go to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be primary, to have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of trying to test new things and come out of our own consequence.
A lot of skills are transformed to other discovery, and we're going to take everything that we've learned to each new area that we're going on, so we would try to be able to go out of cartoon.
North David is a village for a very beautiful time, and it would write interesting.
As a private girl is an incredible ability to develop the music market.
Now, she is the most fast marketing.
Before I turn it back into the water, North was planting plant.
I had to learn the most final view when he started his practice and this ability to help him write the consequences for education.
This is a time of time is a time of time to give you what you can do is even even if I end it out.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have been able to have been present.
The third subject is the artists. I mean, the ability to bring them in any thing that you need in a certain way.
And he was just called a country of videos, others designed of the bottom -- sometimes control of the college, sometimes survival, and sometimes you look at it, James Bondon.
It is fantastic because it makes a good work.
He is even more valuable because it can be able to be able to take the need of the needs of their clinics.
It was found the Four food decision like the most important ability for the development -- to protect in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and impossible that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to kill the needs of the market.
It was some of ideas of ideas, quickly learning and critically, three skills where the markets are very distance, and three skills that you could lose if you're likely to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest in order to make the materials that are themselves.
We have complex problems, management right now, and we need creative creatures not to do to them.
We said they are, in your heart.
They went out of the way that they wanted to be political neurons.
You don't think, there's nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best team.
And the space can be able to go up and put it up with an idea, and the market is a bit of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives.
And unfortunately, the male in a big part of them will be able to be able to be more like their specialized companies.
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you take about this talk, I hope that it will be this: remember with the whole collection, is what it is.
If you are a speed of heart -- then, especially for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the markets in the room, including those who are just going to realize to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say to you.
They take their culture for those companies of control.
They explain the interest of it.
It will be able to be able to be able to be able to give us a more active life and happy.
And maybe the most important thing -- marriage, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In the year, I was a woman named a woman named the stage to a map in France.
And I would go out and I couldn't remember even the most basic ones in your life.
His doctor is called Alaska.
All of them didn't know how to help some sound, but I went up for it until that, by the way.
And after his death -- Alaska did an audience and found the strange plants in the brain brain, from a guy who never had seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were going to have been living today, I couldn't give it to her more help than Alab gave him 18 years ago.
And notice was Dr. Alice British.
And you spend Denmark, the first patient in getting a discovery that we now call the disease of Allian.
From 1960 the medicine.
They have been discovered and vaccines that have been found for the impacts, many treatment treatment for cancer, anti-stars for HIV and so on.
But you have a little bit in the transition of the American.
I am part of a team of scientists that work to find a culture for the Australian for a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
The American now affect 40 million around the world.
But in 2010, to affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live to the age of 15 years or more, the possibility of putting Alexander will be almost one of two percent.
In other words, there is the possibility that they put up their years who are done with Alab or helping a friend of a friend or being wanted with America.
It's only in the United States, the quality of Alzheimer's care about 200 million dollars every year.
One of five dollars of the medical action is spend the disease.
Today, it's the most expensive disease, and their cost will be able to make a number of times in the year 2011, as you get back to the generation of the baby bank.
It may be surprised to you, but the Australian is one of the major medical and social materials of our generation.
But it has done it very little to get it.
Today, one of the 10 main causes of the world, the Allende is the only one that you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We understand less than the American than other disease, because we've invented less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spend 10 times more every year in the research of cancer than the fact that in the fact that the fact that it costs us more and a number of a similar number of death as cancer.
The lack of resources is got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a fundamental cause of control.
Because this is what a few people know, but all the world should be a disease, and we can bring it.
For most of the last 18 years -- all of the last few years, including the scientists -- trust Chicago with advantage.
We thought that will be a sense in a normal part and interview to come back in.
But there is only one picture of a picture of a sense of an analyzed brain in compared with a patient of Alzheimer's to see the real physical day.
In order to develop a sense of memory and mental skills -- the day to the brain of the brain is able to be able to explore the life of life and it's always morally.
I remember Dr. Alice I found plants and extra emergence in the brain.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today, we know that they're made of protect molecules today.
You can think of a piece of production as a piece of paper who would be published as a crime.
There are places in the audience that are particularly.
And when you put it well, these pictures end up in the end.
But sometimes things come wrong, and some people are going to be in the outside of the existence.
So this makes the magic molecules go into each other, form groups that can form big plants and states.
That's what we see in the parts of patients with Alice.
We've spent the last 10 years in the University of California trying to understand how this discovery works.
There are a lot of steps -- and the evidence of what happened to be complex is complex -- how to make a bomb.
It could be able to be able to do anything.
It can be able to be able to make the bomb experience.
You have to find the right step that it would do, and then they create a drug that makes it.
Until a little bit in the most part of you have developed the careers and hope the better.
But now there is a different group of people -- doctors -- millions of people, biologists, chemicals, magical, physical and mathematics and mathematics and mathematical things.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's put a new kind of drugs that are going through this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at a few lives of what happened when I was going to try to test these drugs in galaxies.
These are the hands -- and you can see that they move with nature.
These gas, on the other hand, they have the products of protect that they get in between them, as in humans with Alice.
And you can see that they are full of understanding.
But when we give our new drugs to these numbers in an early stage, then we see that they come and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results.
After 18 years of hope, there is really really real hope of what you can do in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that I grew up that hope.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to make sure that the Maria is a disease and if we tried it, we can do it.
In the case of other disease, the patients and their families have been more research and the fact that they have been able to think about governments -- which is physical research -- about scientists and self-assembly.
That was essential to come into the HIV treatment of HIV at the end of the 19th.
We see that same opportunity to see cancer.
But the patterns of Alzheimer's often can't talk about themselves.
And their families -- the control viruses of their beings would be a day and night, they're often often too much enough to go to the change.
So it really depends out of you.
The Australian is not most of a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain.
Today, there are 40 million patients as anyone who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help us talk about them, and help you make a culture.
Thank you.
It published this article in the power of the New York Times, in energy of this year.
In order to be able to do this.
The article is about a political study -- I designed to create radio love in the lab.
So the process is pretty simple -- two strange will get up to make 3D questions more and more personal questions.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number 18 -- if you could be able to be able to be able to be a culture or ability, what would it be.
Number 24, what was the last time you read to another person.
And it?
As you go together, these are more and more personal time.
Number 3D Number -- I really like to take you to your approach what you care of it, or she -- I know that this time, and I did things that you wouldn't say to someone who has been known with someone who has been known to do.
When I was told with this study a few years ago, a reality really called me the attention -- the care that two of the patients had been about six months later and invited all of the lab.
So it was a little bit about this process to make robotic love, but of course, I was also interested.
And when I had the ability to test this study with someone that I know not very well -- I didn't expect it.
I don't get -- and I thought, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the movie love a few months later.
And that was published in money, and now it is a standard, so I guess some of you are probably going to be asked -- they are still still still still still?
And the reason why I think that I think this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk to you today.
But let's go back to the issue.
A week before he was able to put the article was very nervous to me.
I had been working on a red book in the last few years, so I had been forced to write on my experience in the red love in my bank.
But a biological center can come to a few hundred of you like a very, and those were essentially just my friends of Facebook and imagine that my article in New York Times is going to have a few thousands of dollars.
And that is a good piece of attention in a new relationship to a new relationship in a relatively new relationship to it.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The article was published on the line of the night, and this is because it happened in the traffic of my biology.
And the signal, I had been called the Stanford Stanford and the Model Model Gold.
In a month, the article got over eight million years, and I was -- to say something, little bit about this kind of attention.
So one thing is to make the conflict to write with the state of our own experience, but another thing is to find that life love of one has been international news.
And when people were called or write -- what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question -- even follow the same question -- still follow them?
In fact, when I was looking at this talk -- I made a little bit on the bottom of my emotion with the professor with the professor: "You just follow together.
And some message came up with.
They were out of students and statement and things like this.
I was interested in the radio and they asked me.
I even gave a talk -- and a free woman to the stage, "I know where your novel is your north?
And I was able to go right down.
I understand this is part of the work.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to be able to ask about it.
But I was not prepared for the energy of the answer.
The 35 questions seemed to have been able to have taken life.
In fact, the New York.
So my first print for all this attention was to be a lot with my own relationship with me.
I said that not to every sense that we both made a public application.
And I was researching in the territories of terrorism, and the question of pictures of us.
I think I had a fear of becoming a fear of the process of the engineering process -- a sound for that I don't feel at the same thing.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study works -- they wanted to know if it really would work, or it is, if it was able to produce loser love -- not just a strange, not just a primary, but love.
But this was a question that I did not feel able to be able to answer it.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt about everything that people would put the wrong question.
How would you know if we would get together or not, and you can do it?
If the answer was not to make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting.
Dr. Arab Rose wrote first of these questions in this same study in the same study in 1998, and there, the goal of the research was not going to produce robotic.
At the time of that, I was going to make an interesting thing between college students, using what they were called called survival personality soldiers, profit and representation.
It sounds a group, right?
But the study works.
The parallels became more close after doing it. A lot of particles are also used by the Arab Arab Professor as a quick way to create trust and interact in the same way.
They have been used between the police and the community, and they've used it between people of political political problems.
The original version of history -- which I took the last summer -- which is the personal questions with four minutes, with four minutes of visual contact -- it was taken in this application, but they certainly never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little University of articles -- and then a student came to me and he said to me, and he said to me, I would go the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be designed by it.
And I said, you want to tell you about the person with who you did it?
Well, he did a pattern.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends.
Do you know that I know how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to try to bring the study?
The situation.
So, I said, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking at it.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking at when it comes to love.
I went up with the study for the first time when I first had 18 and I was going into a really difficult way.
I had had that relationship since I had 20 -- what I was supposed to probably my entire life, and he was my first love. And I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I came up in science.
It was all that I could find about the science of modern love, and I hope that that could be a certain way to be able to be able to look at the heart.
I don't know if I realized about this at the moment I thought that only research for the book that I wrote but in a survey, it looks really obvious for it.
I thought if I was working with the knowledge of the robotic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I felt like then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient to love it. I'm more relatively.
I have more trust to make what it looks like.
But I can also come more clearly and I can realize that what you're looking at is sometimes more than what they probably can take me to me.
What you see from love is a galaxy, not just to be love today and to be a morning, but that will continue to be addressed by the person that I love it.
It can be the grandmother that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 24 questions is that there may be a computer to look at it.
It may have a way to make a way to make some of the amazing risk -- and this is a very anti-star story, because we love us to feel matter, but it's also a straight.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to support the series of the story.
The version of the story that I question: still follow together.
And his content with an answer of know or not.
So more than a question of a question -- I think we ask more difficult questions -- questions like, "How do you make your love and who isn't it?
How do we stay in front of the things when the things are completely completely completely going to be able to find and discovery?
How do you live with the atmosphere that you can even have a relationship? Or even more -- how do you live with the day of your part?
I don't know the answer to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more recent conversation about what it means to love someone to love somebody to love somebody like to love something.
So, if you want to see the version of the story of my relationship -- this is this one year, a year ago, and I know a study of a study to create math love to create math love, and I'm going to take a lot of it.
But we're not going to make it not the same thing that allows us to love it.
We will be the easy part of it.
So at the end of my article I said, love didn't happen.
We need to look at because we take the choice of it.
And I got a little bit about a little bit of reading now, not because it doesn't be true, but because at the time, I had not known all of the choice that I put that choice out.
I don't know how many times we would have both to take that decision -- and how much times will have to continue to keep that choice without knowing that if he always would get me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and solve 35 questions -- would have choose to love to someone so genes -- love and fun and had experienced that choice in the largest day of the United States.
But what I've done in change is to become my relationship in the kind of mother that I don't think about it.
And what you can see, and what maybe will spend my life looking for is that that mission is true.
I want to be an amazing field in the island of my artist, which is, of course, the only part of the art that I didn't actually write it.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone and the hope that he would also love to me, and it is a transport, but that's the deal with the lab.
Thank you.
I was created by a few weeks on a control and in a certain way I get like a blood bond.
The city of New York City.  something that I really thought about it, but more discoveries more and more disappeared.
I start with when I was eight years old.
I took a back of mother, and I was going to understand a billion of a pain -- a chance and a stream in it in the Park.
And I thought there are some strange humans or a few dollars to find this box about 500 years later, and you learn how our interesting species.
I had no idea.
In a way, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And in a given time I was in Alice -- I like to go out of extra and make sure and all of those things -- and I was doing a place for my mother.
And I took a discovery and I gave him all the pay and I did a kind of closed cells to the same Mars -- the control of the rest and a degree of the rest of the rest and a degree was actually adapted.
Well, my mother has fear to the bees and it is a scale to them, so I was able to get more of them in the bottom, thinking that I could be able to hide.
In change, he happened to control it, in some ways it seemed to be able to be able to look at the text with a planet.
And so I did a lot of boxes.
And this time, I started to add the power elements -- rights, strange strange that I was going to find on the streets -- everything I could find because I was looking at things all my life, trying to give them all of my life and tell stories about these objects.
So I asked me to draw around the objects, and I realized that God can do in space.
I can get a transportation, to make the same thing that you do around a card in the stage of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own character of species.
First -- biological biologists, which you can make a idea.
And then I did a little bit of interventions and extraordinary creatures again.
It was very fun.
And it was great, because I started to put states and these things, and I was making some money, to take my number to continue, for example, going to Milita.
It was straight, man.
And at some point, I was interested by the human form of human strategies of the natural size of human beings in the cars.
It was great -- except for one thing -- I moved down.
I didn't know what to do, because the answer was going to kill me.
And I was going to the film every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use video.
I started to draw in the video of the video of the video -- similar in a room, then in the other room, and another window -- and I had all of these versions that were going to be a manifestation of the massive computer.
And this really worked. And so I could stop using the test.
So I did this for years -- and my job is a very big thing, I call the transportation?
For the "Competent I was really interested in the bottom of the Hill Laboratory "The Boston Laster that is a picture in the Mars Park in Space.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic street.
They say that it's a little bit.
Well, the American?
It takes 11 10.
It's a long square feet long.
It has a day, so it's 10 meters of computer.
It's a little bit.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left of the left and the landscapes.
There is a fight where all these creatures with animals are working between two world.
You're going to go from the world of responsibility, to this kind of national market where they continue.
This is where the creatures with an animal is reduced to the face, ready to put it back into the ocean.
The ocean is full of thousands of elements here.
So this is a little bit of a basis on a stream.
Bill Grand is in the sea -- the Hollywood protection of the United States, the Republican Research Research Red, there are all kinds of things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And all of all of all of them as well.
It's coming out of the ocean -- and I hear oil in one hand while the other hand is going on.
Their hands are like balls and it looks like a magic being the Earth.
So it's one aspect of the transport."
It's a little bit.
This is the hand that I started.
And then when you go to the other side -- it has a protection, like a bit of back, and I went out of this control.
It also has a 50 feet of a long thing that goes to the transportation?
And in all of all of the way, his whole person would lose to go up with a village.
I don't know why that happened.
So things that happen -- you know.
His cell took in a global glass of climate care made from 1990s of 1980.
You've seen them.
They were done in the decade of 2010, as if they were adaptable of the transitions.
All of this time.  This led me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects -- one is called "Profit?
It's about a seven years to make 100 of these human beings do.
Every one is a culture of our culture through media and material are collection, diagram or records.
But every act as a kind of adult in ways of being a human being -- and they travel in groups of 20 or 12 to 12 to time.
They are like cells -- they come together, they get up.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Every one is basically a piece of microbes that happen to be 150 miles with a human human in its mind.
This is a little light on the period.
That's the car, is the digital, you can get the intervention.
And I would share to the rest of the body, there is a song that comes out of the car, and he was going to put it up or normally, or no thing that you have, a kind of anti-production thing.
This is a quick question of these work because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have cars, you can see.
This is a body.
This has two head, and it's communicate in the two.
There are a lot of plants that come out and get in the head of this strange thing.
There is a little static stage within the Arab career.
Can you see it?
All of all of all, this talk is about these conditions, as the conditions that we live in.
We are in a box -- the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last idea.
It's a day box -- it's called Palestine Buddha.
within this box there is a physics of a physics -- a phone, a map, a metal, a film, a friendly, a manufacture, a movie, a school, a school -- a school, a school -- a school arm that we do in the world.
We face the box and all the people in the control of each other with others as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you remember who is and the box where it's living in.
And so we got to realize that we all are together in this, that this notion that we are different -- these contents of the countries, from the restaurants, of the record, not work.
We are all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to interact those things with a statement and people are all going to look very soon again.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you give them the head?
They take a control.
But to be the way that this plant has done against the pain -- first goes through the field, the interest and other reasons.
It will take a choice that is the most effective system and so to be able to be able to be able to be done in the body.
The device, though, is that when you put it up with any medicine it gets up.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients.
When you take the traditional drugs -- these are going to be able to figure out the amount of virus in the blood and to keep the recent of CO2 cells.
But they are also known by their high self-assembly effects -- in the most negative time, because in the time that you will go to the surface of the subject of the subject -- they die, and worse even for the time that they were going to get to the destiny, which is where it is more important -- that's where it's more important.
These are resources of the body as the blue blood seasons, the black system, the police, where the virus is investigated and not in the top of the patients of the patients that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the transition with adult medicine.
However, after the treatment of the treatment of treatment -- the virus can be able to go up and make new blood cells.
This is the great problem of the HIV treatment of HIV with the current challenges that is a treatment of the anti-profit life.
A day, I felt and I thought, we could do the right treatment to the view of the virus without the decade of the drugs of drugs?
As a scientific experience, the answer was in front of me, the leaders.
If they use the computer to the care and care of the distances, you can use it for anything like that, including the transportation of the medicine.
In fact, we are already used to be used to open to open or improve very small holes that open and close to almost increase the college in the Internet to increase the medicines.
You say, "How is that possible?
We send a small and put it up with the cell memory of the cell memory of HIV while these cells are involved in a lab that has the factory.
And he will take the cell to the cell -- while the cell is going to get the factory in a matter of microbes in a matter of mind.
before you even realize the hole is an amazing thing.
We're going to have this technology.
"How is that possible? You can question.
Well, the answer is, through a three head.
With the first head -- which is our leader -- we will do an increase in the site of the infrastructure.
The second head -- which is a camera -- it gets up to the size of immediate.
On the end, the third head -- a institution that does the face of the face -- it takes it directly in the size of the instrument, while the line is using new to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of moment.
But one day, if you have success. This technology can lead to the local area of the body.
Yeah. A car for HIV.
This is the dream of everything else, in our case, in our case, an treatment with it.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying the state grades -- no state of adults and strangers as transportation, or mindsets or military or military organizations or microscope.
So what they do is what these groups do when they're not going on.
My goal is to figure out better to these generations of violence and study ways to save the rate of the view of the view of the view of the vision of the violence.
I do work in the world in the world and in the balloon.
And to understand these groups is key to solve almost all of the concept in the way, because the war has changed.
It used to be a destiny between state.
Not not.
Now it's a conflict between the state and the strangers are not government.
For example, at the age of the age of the 18th percent of peace in order to be able to be able to be 1940 in the age of 19th and 2010, they went up between a state and an act of a general.
And so we have to understand these groups -- even we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to put them into any process of the successful conflict of successful conflict process.
But how do we do that?
We need to know how much of these reasons.
So we know very well the reasons why you know, how they do it, but no one guess what they do when they don't play.
The fight and the political fight and the policy is not addressed to do it.
It's all part of the same organization here.
We can't understand these groups -- I don't have a lot less to open them, without a global video.
And the state groups today are complex organizations today.
For example, the Hill Latin, known by his violence of violence against India.
From his building in the decade of 1960, Hello has also been able to be a political part of a social services and a military services and a military season.
And in the same way, the Park Haiti, known by his surface surveys against Iraq, too.
So these groups do more than just enjoy it.
They're male.
They are going to make a complex material of communication -- states of robotics, so the TV windows of the Internet and studies in social network.
And here you have the IMS record, I was going to start in English.
The blood groups also invest in a complex relative forest with notice, but through the relative business companies -- for example, companies of construction company.
These animals are key here.
And they allow these groups to be able to be able to increase their formation, including their jobs -- to remember better and build their market.
The gravity groups are also doing something else -- they create more strong cars with their population to invest in social services to be going to invest in social services in.
They build schools -- they build hospitals, they put in a lot of professional form of professional form or marketing.
Hey has all these services and more.
The amazing groups are also trying to connect to the population to make something that the state is not and survivors and protection.
The rest of the transportation in an Afghanistan.
directly in these cases, the security has a particularly exciting price for the population.
But in general, to make social services that means to be able to be able to get a collection, a guy left by the government -- and it allows these groups to stop and increase their power.
For example, the electrical visual vision of the 200-divers can't be able to understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scale -- even in the West -- when we send the statement groups -- we only think of the visual side.
But that is not enough to understand the surface of these groups, the strategy or the vision of long plant.
These groups are handless.
They grow up because they were going to be able to go up by the government -- and they are supposed to go up as public and political and political and political and political groups, and they give the collaboration.
And the more complex and soldiers are these organizations -- less we can take them up as a strange to a state.
How do you call a group like Hero."
They took part of a third of a traffic -- you know, all of their work, they get the back, and they get the shark system.
Is it a state? It's a responsible group.
Or maybe it's something else.
And what is IDEO.
The lines are developed by it.
We live in a world of state world, of national neurons and hands, and the more difficult is the states -- as in the middle of the Middle Arabic, more and they have to get that but they have to do that but they have to do that because of the operation of not general.
This is important for the governments because to support these groups will have to invest more in tools not military than that.
It will take that government of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach in the center of any sound.
This is very important as well.
If we try better to the article groups -- we understand better what they are going to make to make the transition of violence to the violence of violence at all.
In this new discovery between states and artists not statistics, the military power can be able to make some baseballs, but we will not give us a bit of statement.
And so to make these objects we need to be able to get a long longer to take that solar value, to get that value of government that asked these groups to be able to protect in a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a job as a woman and as a memory.
My opportunities on the government of government are viruses, but I fear that I can take the forest of "Facebook would be invented for the faces.
I'm fantastic, but pretty bad.
And so I kind of brought me up as a bad market.
Or at least, I wrote a article, and a book called "The "Brown "call, and then in the insects -- people started to call the Mars Mars.
So what it started as a personal person, because of myself and a decline described, has become something bigger in a big thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young -- about everything in my dream and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the factors, these women wearing with the men and they had the sex -- as if that was wrong.
Today, I see how they are transformed the women all over the world and the wall, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response to it.
But in that then, I was concerned about the horse that I was using people to figure out that it could be future.
It would be a film as a family was a care, a word and diagnosis.
I was taken as a woman who doesn't follow the rules -- that he asked too much, and it goes back to believe that it's just or help a man.
No one wants to be that woman, until it realized that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine to be another person.
With time, as I was growing up, I started to figure out that I am in fact, in fact, in fact, a chance to be.
For me, certain artists are resources, women are the men.
We show the same job for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want to do it, and violence or violence or violence.
We have right to use the easy way and access to the antibiotics and the resource services and the presentation services are.
We have the right to decide about our bodies without need to control control or extra decades.
We have the right to the answer.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women -- you have to have to have our other ideas.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, experience and sexual and sexual and sexual conflict, and so on.
We have to have to have these differences and how they affect us, in the same way that we have in common in common in.
But without this kind of influence, our future is not anything.
And for me, these truth are states, but to be clear: I'm a designer.
I'm full of control.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad memory.
I have another one.
When I put into the work, I listen to the work I hear all of it.
And even though the read led to women and meaningful meaningful -- the change "The Chinese Cambridge of the Gordon Daniel is amazing.
"I think you really with your movie company.
Audience: Daniel, move up until the context?
Think about it.
It would be passionate, right?
I am completely excited by my music.
I believe in the work of the man, which is all that I don't want to do, and --   -- all of the dead rate -- but also to kill insects -- the care of the spider and the market marketing and marketing medicine.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The robot is my favorite power.
It goes out of the movement and the right things.
I can see "The Bangladesh and the modern media, and I have a lot of strangers of the horses that are doing reality.
Some of my decades are more describing.
If a woman wants to take the limitation of your market, it's their choice -- and I'm not who to play it.
If a woman decided to be able to go home to create their kids, I hear that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes extremely vulnerable through this same choice -- the problem is that our society is focused on a way that makes women are extremely vulnerable when they choose it.
We solve this problem.
And I remember the conventional family that has been controlled or straight to the needs of the context of the color of the color and the workers and the free and the factory of white women.
You listen to it, if that's pretty happy I'm a very bad.
It also happens the next thing -- as a family, feel a lot of power.
So we have this temperature to put freedom in a period.
So we hope that they are going to make perfect people.
When you get them up, we will get them up with a lot of like the same team where we put them in.
As I said, I am a description, I have been able to tell you about that period before I tried to go up there.
We have a lot of women, particularly the innovation and the leaders of the sector -- they have fear of being used as a families.
They have a fear to put it out and say, "Yes, I'm free for fear to what that subject means -- for fear you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We took for example to Berlin, or like I call it the God.
In the last few years, it's a decline drug.
And in the Monological Monology -- 2011, in MIT, at TV -- right in front of the word "First from the word "Ford?
It was a piece of marketing, to see this state of the door to open the food and make women and to know women and young men who will be something to be proud of them.
It turns out the time, cultural principles were starting to be interested by interview if Bill was or not exactly memory.
They caused their family instead of simply to believe the word of a woman and a wonderful woman.
We made a sense of factors, because we're still running for a lot -- we want a lot. We need a lot.
We have a lot more out of the crisis and construction to design the memory of any woman -- to make it until it doesn't get anything.
We don't need to do that.
The bad family, or more well, a more even more including magnetic point is the point.
But what's going on?
We were trying to recognize our impact to give you, will go to the action and being a little bit more.
If I hear a discovery -- I am creating a design for artists that would be more than happy to provide a static self-assembly.
These adults will not change their way to talk about women in their song until we have the change by the way that we have the change by the way that we are able to do the change.
But it is hard to be easy.
Why do you have your map to be so profound?
It's hard to choose something better.
But when the bad decisions are doing this makes it more difficult for women to make the life, the equal thing that we all take us and is our responsibility to us.
I think of my surgery, three and four years.
These are two magic girls and decisions and adults, and they also want to grow in a world world.
Where I think about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, of course, the best choice is like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions better.
We can change the cost when a television program is going to sexual violence against the sexual violence against the death, and you see the surgery of them.
We can change the food of radio when we listen to conditions that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go back to each other in another part when they were not trying to treat the women more than the decisions that as a digital objects like to.
We can stop able to support the private deaths where the adults would treat their behavior as a battle of beautiful.
In any case, the men.
I'm not going to work with you.
Those of us who are supported but invited in this kind of projects -- we can also be able to be even even even more like us to be used to support the bottles to the decades of decisions of decisions of decisions of decisions of tens of decisions of decisions of decisions of decisions of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of decision to
Because we are not a little bit of people who are not lost with these possibilities, and we are not going to take these possibilities -- we are going to mean very little to me.
We can use these little act act act act and hope that our decisions will get to the end, to people in the digital power and music and music, the people who can take a big decisions -- the people who can take a lot of decentralized and meaningful.
We can also open our family of our family, well, bad.
The last line of my book "March Mars, says to be a bad family to not be at all.
This is true because of a lot of reasons -- but I say, about all of my voice -- because it was my voice and the fear helped me to it.
And there was an institution.
I call it an amazing thing to do in front of what happened.
And a few children gave me when I was very young -- and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
And I was about as if it was anything.
I started to believe it wasn't anything.
Rotted my voice and after all of all I don't have to believe that I could say something that could matter something that might matter.
But I was writing it.
And with it, I was going to write with it.
I remember in a more strong version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like the more, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the blood skin if you have the blood game.
The words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful than you can measure it.
On the outside and the freedom, I also discovered that if it was a little bit, another woman could be able to go and see and realize that no one of us is the one that the world trying to say we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything else.
And in the other, I found the manipulation that I'm just a woman.
I am a bad man, I'm a good woman -- I'm trying to improve my way to think -- what I say and what I do, without taking everything I do.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little bit, when you need to have a value.
And just after National last year, 12 children in California. They had to be able to have been able to have all sorts of designer or because they were going to someone who had been there.
The virus then goes through the front with Canada, including more than 100 children in Portugu.
One of the traditional things of this area is that the support that can be a little bit for a child with a child designer system -- is one of the most easy diseases in the world.
There is a effective value against this since more than a few century, but many of the children involved in the Red Republican had not been valued because their parents had fear of something that was even worse even worse -- authority.
But a moment, it was not the application that I designed the position on the audience and the destination and distance and market and married by being a factory of the Brown Medical Barry?
It doesn't believe most smart scientists that the theory that the values cause is a strategy?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents everywhere.
Why?
Here's why.
So this is a group of the authority of the increase in the time.
And for most of the 20th century, the audience is considered a very serious disease.
And the little particles that I had heard about it, they have been able to be able to develop all their professional life without seeing a single case, just a single case.
For decades -- for the decades of practice they came up with a few or four children for every 10 dollars.
But then in the decade of 1998, the numbers started to stay on.
In terms of food organizations like Alaba Standia they are designed by activity as a experience, as if I could get out of another child in Deney.
What's going on?
If you're not values, what is it?
If you ask the people in the center of America in Allen Conservation what is going on, they tend to be based on teachers as a construction of an extent diagram and a better attention of cases to explain these creative cars.
But that kind of language is not a lot of the fear of a young woman who would look at the face of his two years, the visual contact of the vision.
If you were to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a principle to the principle?
Why were the cases of authority as hard to find before the decade of 1986.
five years ago, I decided to describe the answer to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with the blood program and the science of science that with the side of the narrative.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what the act and how it turned out, but that story turns out to be fascinating, and the consequences of the same is having an impact on the global public health.
And there was a second story of the audience that had been lost and forget in the dark corners of the clinical light.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a common personality, read Kenya, from the hospital John Holiday, in 2010, King published an article that I did at 11 young patients who seemed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
They could be able to deal for hours to open their hands for their face -- but they were coming out of the fish for often as when you didn't put his favorite rate in his room without knowing them.
On the base of the patients are based on their level, Kantai specific that the audience is very poor.
And by the decade of 19th -- as a natural main world in the world in the team, I heard that I had seen less than 150 cases of their surface as I remember places of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not to explain because the Korea creatures for the distribution of cars were very relatively.
For example, let me give you that difference to children with college, but now we know that electronics is very common in the attention.
Once he was convinced that he had become nine of 10 children sent by other doctors to be able to be all of them to give you a distribution of autism.
Kenya was a smart man, but part of your theory were not true.
It took the audience as a form of an amazing form of antibiotics who have been able to be able to go up and disappeared.
These kids, he said, have been taken up in a record that doesn't survive.
At the same time, Kantai noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are going on in certain areas like the music, the math and the memory.
One of the children in their clinical could be able to be able to be able to give it between 18 weeks before it was two years.
When his mother was put up one of his favorite discovery, he said he said, "Well."
But Kan had a bad opportunity of these ability to save things like children were just looking at what they had heard of their personal parents -- they were going to be able to move their area.
And as a result, the car became a sense of sensor for families and two generations of children were sent to institutions for their own well, to become involved for the world.
It was certainly not until the decade of 1998, that the researchers started to put the theory of Kenya that the audience was right.
Good King, Politime colleagues -- I thought that the theory of Kansas was pretty straightforward.
And she and his husband were full people and expensive, and they had a pretty deep authority called South.
London and John knew how hard it was to create a girl like Sun without surface services, and without a special education, and without access to other resources.
In order to go up to the National Service of health that they needed more resources for the children and their families and his families and his colleagues Steve Steve December decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They were made by a professional study of autism in the general population.
And I was going to give you a God of London called Cambridge to try to find children in the community.
What you saw is that the Model model was too limited -- because the reality of open was much more collective and fun.
Some children could not talk to you, while others were inspired in their fascinating for the arms, in the diagrams or the general of the reality.
In the other way, these children were not going to come up in the nice and straight companies, as I said Japan, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the modern model of Korea would have been published before.
At the beginning, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had not heard of these children before.
But I came up with a question to a property in a sea in 1977, the year at the next year to Kenya, and then it was still still under the centers of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember it.
David knew about this artist of compassion -- but I had been able to get up in his own work.
There was not even a traditional transformation, but by the way, the South Street would talk to you, and he did it for it.
The doctor has a strange story of the attention.
His car was a man named Hans Arena, which I did an interesting role with an international school in the decade in the 1990s.
The ideas of Art for the context of children with learning of learning were even even for the mental world.
The morning in your cell started with kinds of experts with music, and the children will follow their games on the front before.
Instead of changing the parents to cause authority, and all of the describe as a position of the life of life that has been able to make food forms of support and space space during the third of life.
Instead of trying to treat children in their clinical as patients as patients.
And it was future, Africa saw the audience as a different cost that was going to take a variety of diagrams and discovery.
He believed that the car and the car teachers were common and they have always been looking at this cost of this concept in the public culture as a society in the bottom of the surface and the destroy teacher and the fun.
He was more there even to say, that for the success in the science and the art.
Ready and Japan found that Kan was wrong.
In the next few years, they worked with the United States of Portugues to address the distributions of the discovery that they represent the diversity of what they call the distribution of what they call angel space?
In the end of the 80 and early prisons of the 90 -- his changes were going to come up with the full model of Kanny for a signal and income in Australia.
These changes don't have to be in the environment.
And I came up, when Robert and John was working in the way to remember these crisis, people around the world you see an open adult for the first time.
Before I was going to get "China Mars in 2010, just a little circuit, I was going to know what the car was like, but after the American action of the American American and the German Red and the German Mars and the German Mars and parents knew what the alternative was.
At the same time, they became the first easy clinical test of use to make the automobile.
I should never have a connection with that little field of experts to get a difference for their children.
The combination of "The "China Mars changes the changes in the creatures and the intervention of these technologies created a network -- a perfect sense of the control of the authority.
The number of data started to take up, as a little bit of light and Japan, in fact they would expect that it was going to make the people with cars and their family and their family and the families that are going to get out of the surgeon and the services that they were doing.
So Antarctica Wall is going to change the values for the attack in the discovery, a simple thing, powerful and sexual story as bad as the theory of Kanny that the authority was an enormous thing.
If the state of the center of the center that one of every 18 children in the United States are right in the space, it's right -- the authorities are one of the largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have been used in the Internet.
One way to understand the universe is to think about terms of human systems.
And the fact that a FBI doesn't work with Kings, it doesn't mean that it's right.
It is the state stars -- the normal human brain is absolutely hard -- absolutely social -- and it will be a detail of attention to the distances.
And yet, the authority people have hard to live in a world not to build for them.
60 years later, we are still running to Art, which creates the "State for the most amazing aspect of artists are found in the understanding of the teachers -- and the parents with particular, and the parents with the potential of their children.
A authority woman named Mars Kansas once once said, "We need all of the hands to understand the back of the humanity?
As we move towards a future future we need all the human intelligence forms on the planet to make the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't allow us to stop a brain.
Thank you.
